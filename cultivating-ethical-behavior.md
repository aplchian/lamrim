## How you engage in virtue and turn away from non virtue after you have reflected on karma and its effects in general and in detail



### A General Explanation

```
From non virtue comes suffering;
How can I truly be free of this?
If is fitting that all times, day and night.
I think only of this.

- Shantideva
```

```
For the Sage has said that conviction
Is the root of all virtues,
And to constantly meditate on fruitional effects
Is the root of this conviction.

- Shantideva
```

Thus, having understood virtuous and non virtuous karma and their effects, do not leave it at just an understanding but meditate on it over and over, because this is a very difficult subject and difficult to acquire certainty about.


Have conviction in the teachings of the Tathagata, and then sustain your meditation on them. If you do not have this uncontrived certainty about this quality of truth in the buddhas teachings, then you will not gain certainly that will please the conqueror with regard to any of the teachings.

Some claim to have certainty about emptiness are uncertain about karma and its effects and do not value it. This is a mistaken understanding of emptiness.

Once you understand emptiness, you will see that it is the meaning of dependent-arising, and it will assist you in becoming certain about karma and its effects.

Develop certain knowledge of dependent-arising to gather with the causality of the 2 kinds of karma, and examine your physical, verbal, and mental actions all day and all night. **From this you will put an end to miserable rebirths**

On the other hand, if you don't have a deep understanding of karma, and have a lax attitude with your physical, verbal, and mental actions you are throwing the door open to the miserable realms. 

We need to act according to the Dharma. And examine our mind, to see if we are or are not.

```
If someone who knew how to examine our mind-stream were to do so, that person would soon find something that had gone quite far from the teachings -- like sending a ball of thread down a steep incline

-Dolungba
```

How you turn away from wrongdoing once you have reflected in this way is stated:

```
O king, do not kill.
Life is very dear to all beings.
Hence, they want to maintain their lives for a long time.
So think not of killing, even in the depths of your mind

- Chapter on the Truth Speaker
```

Apply this attitude of restraint toward the 10 non virtues as well as the misdeeds mentioned previously. Don't even let the motivating thoughts arise. Become accustom to thes attitude and use it frequently.

**If you do not reject suffering in this way, you will experience suffering. No matter where you go, you will not be free from it.**

It is not sensible to engage in actions that seem to give short term happiness but lead to suffering in the future. On the other hand, it is sensible to engage in actions that give you faultless happiness and delight when you experience the ripening effects.

### In Particular, the way to purify through the 4 powers.

Though you make great effort not to be defiled by wrongdoing, faults may arise due to such things as carelessness and preponderance of afflictions. If this happens, you shouldn't disregard them without bring, so you must try to apply the remedy about which the buddha spoke.

```
Maitreya, if bodhisattvas, the great heroes, possess these 4 teachings, then they will overcome any sins that they have committed and accumulated. What are the four? They are the power of eradication; the power of applying remedies the power of turning away from faults; and the power of the foundation.

-Sutra giving the Four Teachings
```

#### 1. The power of eradication

This power is great remorse for having done non virtuous actions since beginning less time.  In order to feel this, it is necessary to meditate on the way in which you produce the 3 effects of actions -- fruitional and so forth. At the time of putting this into practice, do so by way of the 2 methods -- the confusion of sins in the Sutra of Golden Light, and the confession of sins by way of the 35 buddhas.

#### 2. The power of applying remedies

This power has 6 sections:

1. **Dependence on the profound sutras** - includes such actions as receiving the oral transmission of sutras such as the prajnaparamita, retaining their meaning, and reading them.
2. **Interest in emptiness** - to comprehend the reality in which there is no self and which is luminously clear, and to have conviction that the mind is primordially clear
3. **Dependence on recitation** - to recite, according to the rituals, the special formulae such as the 100 syllable mantra of Vajrasattva. Repeat the recitations until you see signs that you have cleared away your sins.
4. **Dependence upon images** - to make images of the Buddha once you have acquired faith in him
5. **Dependence upon worship** - to make a variety of offerings to an image of the Buddha or to a stupa
6. **Dependence on names**- to hear the recitation of and retain the names of the buddhas and great conquerors children
