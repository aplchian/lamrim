# Prayer To The Lion Faced Dakini

**Ga la chö päi nä chhog dam pa nä**  
**Ngön she dzü thrül nga wäi thu tob chän**  
**Drub pa po la ma yel bu zhin zig**  
**Nä sum kha dröi tsog la chhag tshäl lo**

I prostrate to the gathering of dakinis in the three chakras  
Who abide in the holy yoga of using space.  
By your powers of clairvoyance and magical emanation,  
Look after practitioners like a mother her child.  

**AH KA SA MA RA / TSA SHA DA RA / SA MA RA YA PHAT**

**[OM] TADYATHA GATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHI SVAHA**

**Phag pa kön chhog sum gyi käi den päi tob kyi chhir**  
By the teachings of the three supreme jewels possessing the power of truth,  

**Log par gyur chig (clap 1x)**  
May inner and outer hindrances be transformed.  
**me par gyur chig (clap 1x)**  
May they be dispelled  
**zhi war gyur chig (clap 1x)**  
May they be pacified  
**dra geg par chhä mi thün päi chhog ri ngän pa tham chä shintim kuru ye svaha**  


**Geg rig tong thrag gyä chu zhi wa dang**  
**Mi thün nö päi kyin dang dräl wa dang**  
**Thün par drub ching phün sum tshog gyur päi**  
**Tra shi de kyang deng dir de leg shog**  

May all negative forces opposed to Dharma be completely pacified.  
May the host of eighty thousand obstacles be pacified.  
May we be separated from problems and harmful conditions to Dharma; may all enjoyments be in accord with the Dharma;  
And may there be auspiciousness and perfect happiness here right now.
