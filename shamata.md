##Shamata

### Preconditions for Shamata
1. Dwelling in an appropriate area
2. Having little desire
3. Being content
4. Completely giving up many activities
5. Practicing pure ethical discipline
6. Completely ridding yourself of thoughts of desire and so on


It is easy to practice if you are satisfied with what you have, and difficult if you have many desires for things you do not have. 

You should give up worldly activities, such as commerce or excessive socializing.  Developing single pointed concentration requires intensive meditation practice and these sorts of activities are distractions. 

Even if you have not taken any vows your should try to guide your activities in a virtuous direction and guard against the 10 non virtues of body, speech, and mind. This is important, if your sense organs are not controlled, it is difficult to tame your mind.  

The basis of meditative stabilization and wisdom is pure conduct, just as nutrient rich soil is the foundation of a healthy plant.

Desiring objects of the 5 senses and, longing for worldly goals, dwelling in anxieties or wishes, and so forth should be avoided as much as possible when training in shamata.  It is difficult to have peaceful and calm meditation with these types of thoughts.  The desire for worldly things like wealth, fame, and praise must be countered by considering their faults. If you do not see their advantages, you may become mentally and physically trapped in them.  

You should meditation on how attachment and the negative activities it propels could lead you to fall into a lower rebirth.

Another antidote to thoughts of desire is to meditate on impermanence.  All samsaric things, whether attractive or unatractive are transitory.  Recognizing the impermanent nature of both ourselves and those things will lessen desire.

Shamata depends on these 6 conditions in that they facilitate the generation of good concentration.  

Among these 6 the most important are maintaing ethical discipline, ridding ourselves of thoughts of desire, and dwelling in appropriate area. 

```
We think that the faults lie in our personal instructions. As we then seek only personal instruction, we are unable to attain concentration.  This is the result of not abiding under its conditions.  

- Dromtompa
```

You must have the prerequisite conditions. If these conditions are not present, no matter how many special instructions you recieve, you will not attain shamata.  
When you do have the pre-requisite conditions the special instructions will work perfectly.

The Buddha taught that the 4 four of the 6 perfections are also preconditions for attain shamata -- generosity, ethical discipline, patience, and perseverence.

- When you perfect generosity you do not seek things for you own benefit. 
- Part of the perfection of patience is the ability to take on hardships for a wholesome purpose.  
- Being well trained in pure conduct is the perfection of ethical discipline.  
- The perfection of perseverence is having a genuince enthusiasm for practicing the path and cultivating virtue.  

If you have these 4 perfections, the distractions and mental obscurations that are hindrances to shamata are subdued. Your environment and mental states become much more conducive to successfull practice and you are able to achieve shamata much more quickly. 

**Therefore, do not neglect the first 4 perfections**

### How to cultivate shamata on that basis

#### 1. Preparation

Shamata is not limited to people who have trained in the first 4 perfections, it is practiced and acheived by both buddhists and non-buddhists.  

The practice of shamata does not require a deep level of understanding of emptiness or actualization of the method side of the path.  It is common to many different paths, but the way of approaching it for bodhisattvas is unique.  

The 6 preconditions are important, but a mahayana practitioner should in addition meditate for a long time on bodhichitta.  Although shamata does not require bodhichitta, it is important for mahayana practitioners to set their motivation for the development of shamata to be the benefit of all sentient beings.  Bodhisattva's see that cultivating shamata can be of tremendous assistance. They begin serious practice of shamata for that reason.

So, you should meditate on the preciousness of a human rebirth and how quickly it can be lost. When you die you will likely fall to a lower realm and will be enveloped in suffering.  You will then have little chance to gain another rebirth with opportunites and advantages.  You then take refuge in the buddha, dharma, and sangha... the only thing that will help at the time of death.  

Then meditate on the pervasive suffering in samsara and see that all realms in samsara have the nature of suffering. Even though the higher realms have no immediate suffering, they will eventually end and the being will fall back down to the lower realms. See that all persuing pleasure is pursuing the causes of future suffering.  When you realize the first noble truth -- the truth of suffering you will cast aside all desire for samsaric activities.  

Then contemplate how just as you are enmeshed in this suffering, so are all sentient beings.  Think about how all sentient beings have been kind to you in the past and how everything you have is due to these beings who are suffering. How can stand seeing these being in so much pain?  You should then resolve to devote your every action to perfecting youself... only then will you be able to help relieve their suffering.  How can you help them if you can't even help youself?  

**these contemplations help develop bodhichitta -- these are all excelent preperations for shamata practice**



#### 2. Actual Practice

There are 2 subtopics under the general subject of the actual practice: meditative posture and the meditative process itself.

##### a. Meditative Posture

-

It is often helpful at the beginning to count your breath up to 21 until your mind is settled and internalized.

When your mind settles you do not need to count your breathes any longer

##### b. The Meditative Process

If you train in the preconditions and practice with perseverence by following these instructions there is no doubt that you will attain shamata. 

When trying to achieve shamata there are 5 faults or obstacles that must be overcome. The 8 antidotes that combat these are the same in both sutra and tantra.  

Achieving shamata requires preperation. You must familiarize yourself with the teachings of the masters of the past. 

Tsongkhapa's explanation on the meditative process itself has 2 topics:
1. How to develop flawless concentration
2. The stages in which mental states are thereby developed

# 1. How to develop Flawless Concentration
a) what to do prior to focusing your attention on an object of meditation
b) what to do while focusing on an object
c) what to do after focusing on an object


## a) what to do prior to focusing your attention on an object of meditation

In order to achieve shamata you must be free of the 5 obstacles to its achievement.  

1. Laziness, or not wanting to exert effort into practice is the first obstacle. 
2. Having the motivation, but forgetting the instructions is second. 
3. During actual meditation mental laxity and its opposite, excitement are obstacles... the comprise the 3rd obstacle to achieving shamata. 
4. The 4th obstacle is failing to apply the antidote. When an obstacle arises, you need to immediatly need to apply the antidote to free yourself from it. 
5. The 5th obstacle is unnecessary application the antidotes.

It is important to know the 8 antidotes.  4 of them are for combatting laziness and the other 4 are specific.  

*Before you begin to meditate is very important to reduce or remove laziness. 

Laziness has 4 antidotes:

1. Faith
2. Aspiration
3. Perseverence
4. Mental Pliancy

To start with, cultivate again and again a confidence that is aware of the good qualities of concentration.

The 4th.. mental pliancy is actually the result of the first 3. In short, the antidote to laziness is perseverence .. joyous effort. 
The real antidote to laziness is the perseverence that takes joy in practicing meditation. 

In order to generate perseverence you need aspiration. A strong aspiration to engage in shamata comes from contemplating the benefits of the practice. This is not blind faith. You must actually understand the benefits. When you see the benefits, small and great.. you will be attracted to the practice. As the attraction becomes stronger, the aspiration to practice will come. When you have aspiration you will have the perseverence to practice with commitment.

Without aspiration you will not persevere in your practice. 

In short it is important to understand: 
1. Why shamta is valuable.
2. What its benefits are.
3. What you need to do to attain it.
4. How long it may take to develop.
5. What type of hardships or sacrifices may be involved, and how to address these. 

**What are the the great benefits or acheiving shamata?**  

1. It counteracts the wild and uncontrolled mind that hampers you on the spiritual path.  This wild mind leads to negative actions, etc.  If you have a controlled mind you will be able to engage in virtuous acts and refrain from non virtuos acts.
2. Shamata is the basis of a peaceful and enlightened mind. When you achieve shamata your mind will be happy, content, and filled with delight. Your body will also have a bliss. With this physical and mental pliancy your mind is suitable for work to achieve enlightenment. Shamata in union with vipasyana is the true antidote to suffering and your problems. It is the foundation for achieiving liberation from samsara. 
3. You achieve supranormal powers that help you benefit sentient beings.

Once you have strong faith in the benefits of shamata, laziness with subside. You will not want to delay practice even one moment. Once you are inspired to practice, hardships will seem small compared to the great fruits of attaining shamata. 

Even after attaining shamata you should remember these instructions again and again so that your motivation does not wane. This is how you produce and obtain faith.

Now you have faith, now what?

## b) What to do while focusing on an object of meditation.

1. identify the object of meditation upon which your attention is set
2. how to focus your mind on the object of meditation.

#### identify the object of meditation upon which your attention is set


##### The objects of meditation themselves.

The Buddha taught 4 types of objects of meditation

1. Universal objects of meditation
2. Objects of meditation for purifying your behaviour
3. Objects of meditation for cultivating Expertise
4. Objects of meditation for purifying afflictions

**1. Universal objects of meditation**

The four types of universal objects of meditation:  
1. discursive images
2. non-discursive images
3. limits of existence
4. achievement of your purpose

The first 2 are generated by the meditator. They are mental images or reflections of thought in the mind. 

Discursive images or concepts are byproducts of analytical thought and thus are objects of vipasyana.

Non-discursive images are byproducts of non analytical thought and are objects of shamata

Shamata is a single pointed meditation without analysis. The mind is merely focusing on an object. The mind becomes stabalized, and the image of the object that appears to the mind is like a reflection. 

The third object is called 'limits of existance'.
