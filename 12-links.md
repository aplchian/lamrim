12 Links of Dependent Origination

In order to gain the powerful motivation required to follow the path to the end we need to begin with a clear realization with what's wrong with samsara.

We crave birth in samsara because we do not know what a thoroughly miserable place it is. That is one of the main causes for not being able to gain freedom from it.

Through studying, analyzing, and meditating on the 12 links we can come to understand quite clearly how cyclic existance evolves and this can lead us to a direct and clear understanding of selflessness.

When you replace ignorance, the first link, with wisdom, you naturally bring about a revolution in your actions, your karma... the second link. Up until now, everything we do has been on the samsaric side.. but once you begin acting out of wisdom.. everything turns around completely and whatever you do becomes the practice of purification.. leading to emancipation.

By understanding this causal process, you will come to a firm understanding of selflessness.

The multifarious effects we experience as life in samsara arise from a conjuction of many many different causes and conditions.

What we will be discussing here is primarily the dependent arising of affliction.  **This is the way impure, samsaric phenomena arise based on causes and conditions having at their root the obscuring affliction of ignorance** .. you could also talk about the depend arising of purification in which you look at the causes and conditions that cause liberation.


## Ignorance

Ignorance is the root cause of everything in samsaric life.. from rebirth to all the experiences you have in all your lifetimes. All the experiences are the ripening results of karma.  Karma depends on afflictions and all the afflictions depend on ignorance.

There are different systems of explaing ignorance

Vasubandhus system doesnt consider ignorance the mere absence of knowing, but ignorance is something that is contrary to and directly opposed to knowing.  

Here knowing is knowing the true nature of the self and the true nature of phenomena. The cause of cyclic existance is *not knowing* the true nature of the self and then grasping at self that is contradictory and opposed to its true nature.  Ignorance is not a mere absensce of knowing wisdom, nor something other than that wisdom, -- it involves holding affirmatively to a conception that is contradictory and incompatible with knowing wisdom.

```
Here, the antidote, knowledge is understanding the truth, meaning the selflessness of the persons. It's opposite is the view of the transitory collections, which grasp at a self of persons.

- Dharmakirti  - Commendium of Valid Cognition

The antidote to ignorance is knowledge, which is seeing the truth, understanding the meaning of selflessness. The opposite of that is the view of *the transitory collections* which regards the 5 aggregates and based upon that collection imputes a substantial self, which is then conceived of as real, independent, and substantially existant. 

Vasubandhu and his brother Asanga do not agree that ignorance is actually grasping at an incorrect conception of reality.  They say that ignorance is merely *not knowing* the true nature of reality.

These are the 2 definitions of ignorance:
1. Wrong understanding of reality - Vasubandhu
2. Mere not knowing the true - Asanga

Regardless of the disagreement, they both agree that the principle antidote of ignorance is the wisdom that realizes selflessness.

According to Asanga's Comendium of Knowledge there are **2 types of ignorance**:
1. Not knowing about the cause and effect of karma and its results. The ignorance of the consequences of virtuous and non-virtuous actions underlies non virtuous action and it is teh type of ignorance that gives rise to the lower rebirths.
2. Not knowing the true nature of ultimate reality. It is this type of ignorance that leads you to be born in the higher realms of cyclic existance. To be born in the higher realms you must perform virtuous actions, but those virtuous actions are still motivated by an interest in gratifying a self that does not exist.

The root motivation of samsaric virtuous karma is ignorance of the true nature of the self.

Although each individual act has its own immediate, proximate motivation, the fundamental motivation that underlies them all is this grasping at a false conception of self.

For both these types of ignorance the antidotes is knowledge, understanding, and realization; and the ultimate antidote to the fundamental misconception of self is wisdom realizing emptiness.


## 2. Formative Activity

These are the actions that arise because of ignorance, which become the causes and conditions that eventually bring all future results... in short, this refers to karma.  Karma is action of body, speech, and mind and there are 2 types, virtuous which produce happy rebirths and non virtuous which create lower rebirths. There are 2 types of virtuous karma.. 1) **Meritorous** karma which projects rebirth in the desire realm and 2) **immovable karma** which projects rebirth in the form and formless realms. **For all samsaric karma the underlying cause is ignorance.**


## 3. Consciousness

In general the sutras speak of 6 consciousness'. The 5 sense consciousness plus mental consciousness. The 3rd link refers to the mental consciousness.

Motivated by the ignorance of self-grasping you take actions of body, speech, or mind.  Each action deposits a seed or impression on the consciousness which carries that seed forward as a potential, and will eventually riped and yield a result in the form of some type of future life experience.

To make this clear we can divide the conciousness into 2:

1. Causual consciousness - the consciousness that receives the impression deposited by a seeding action and carries it forward until it meets the conditions for that seed to ripen.  **In general, it is the causual consciousness that we call the 3rd link.**
2. Resultant Consciousness - The first moment when that consciousness becomes conjoined with the new life right after ripening.

The consciousness that receives and carries forward those karmic seeds is called the **causal consciousness**. The consciousness at the first moment when such a seed ripens as birth in one of the happy migrations is called the **resultant consciousness**.

## 4. Name and Form

Name refers to the combination of the 4 non-physical aggregates... feelings, discrimination, mental formations, and consciousness.

These non physical parts of the mind-body continuum which combine to create the mental life of an individual are what we are really talking about when we talk about a 'person', a 'being', a 'personality, or a life.

Form refers to the physical aggregate that we call the body.

For all beings except the formless realm, the mental aggregates join with the body at the moment of conception.... as the 5 aggregates come together life begins. **That development period is called 'Name and Form'.** 

These 5 aggregates between the period of conception and the stage when the 6 sense organs have developed is given the designation **'Name and Form'**. The body consisting of the combined blood and semen before the 6 consciousness' have formed is called **form**.  The four mental aggregates as they exist in this developmental period are designated 'name' because they form a basis or referent for naming.

In brief, the period during which the fetus is developing through these five stags, up intil the six sense organs are complete, is designated 'name and form'

## 5. The 6 Sense Bases
We we have the continuation of the mind body complex that is developing in the 4th link. The 6 sense bases refers to this development phase during which the person develops the **capability** to experience an object through the coming together of sense faculty, object, and object.. although that contact has not yet taken place.  With name and form you have an actual body, and with the 6 sense bases the specific physical properties of that embodiment are fully developed, and the sensory faculties thereby become utilizable instruments

## 6. Contact

Once the sense faculties are formed they begin to operate. Contact is the moment when a faculty, and object of cofnition, and a moment of consciousness meet. In dependence on this moment of contact the object is distinguished as attractive, unattractive, or neutral. There are 6 kinds of contact corresponding to the 6 faculites and 6 consciousness.

## 7. Feeling
Depending on whether you have contact with an attractive, unattractive, or neutral object, you experience a pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral feeling. When contact and feeling are complete, the experience is complete.  

This is how you experience life. Sometimes you have pleasant feelings, sometimes you have unpleasant, and sometimes neutral.  **Feeling is the experience of the ripening of your karmic seeds.** One feeling after another, that is the way you experience your life. Most of your life is directed at experiencing pleasant feelings.

Each experience of feeling is the ripened fruit of karmic seeds you planted in the past and results of causes you created by your previous actions.
Beings in the form and formless realm experience only pleasant feelings during their whole life, while beings in the hell and lower realms experience suffering. Humans and some other beings in the desire realm experience mixed good and bad.  But for all beings in cyclic existance, the feelings they experience are the reipening of the previous karma.

**Contact is the point at which the subjective components of experience--- the faculty and consciousness -- meet and utilize the object; at that point the object role in the experience is complete. From that contact -- feeling -- the subjective react arises; this is the experience of the object as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. This feeling is the ripening of previous karmic seeds, and once that feeling has arisen, the entire experience is complete -- the karmic seeds have yielded their result**

## 8. Craving

Craving is attachment. When an enjoyable feeling arises, you become attached to it. You dont want to seperate from it -- on the contrary you want more and better.  Even when pain and discomfort arises there is craving, but in this case the craving is to be frrom that unpleasant feeling.

Tsonghkapa says that the phrase 'craving arises out of the result of feeling' needs to be qualified. Feeling itself is not the ultimate cause of craving. Craving is caused when feeling is accompanied by ignorance.  When a feeling arises it is rooted in ignorance and is dominated by ignorace.

Therefore when a feeling of pleasure or aversion arises towards an object, that object is being perceived in a distorted way.  Because of ignorance the feeling arises based on this mistaken perception; when that feeling is pleasurable you desire the object and want to posssess it, when unnatractive you desire separation. In either case the feeling gives rise to the craving only because it is dominated by ignorance.

**Craving is another word for desire.** Not all desire is non-virtuous, like the desire to be a bodhisattva, etc. When a desire that that is free from ignorance or other afflictions it does not operate to perpetuate entrapment in cyclic existance.

**Once ignorance is cut out, feeling still arises, by craving does not.** 
ex. arhats experience pleasant feelings, and buddhas experience blissful feelings, but because the feelings are not dominated by ignorance, they will not give rise to craving or attachment.


The nexus between the 7th and 8th link provides a good illustration of how these 12 links operate as a chain of causation.

A feeling is a result of a culmination of a previous set of causes -- ignorance, karma, consciousness, etc. And when that feeling arises that particular sequence of cause and result is complete.  But at the same time that feeling is giving rise to a new craving, which may take the form of attachment, aversion, or some other affiliction.  That new craving will motivate new karma, and a whole new-cause result sequence will be set into motion by the completion of the last one. In this way, the cahin of experience within on lifetime, and the cahin of lifetimes within cyclic existnce, perpetuate themselves. That self-perpetuating process is what the 12 links of dependent origination is really talking about.

**These points make it clear that the 8th link of craving, or attachment, plays a central role in perpetuating and structuring samsaric existance.**
