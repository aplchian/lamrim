#Essence of Eloquence

## Chapter 2. Explanations of the Scriptures Statements


> Asanga states in the Bodhisattva Stages: How is reality discovered? It is discovered by the avoidance of the missaprehension which reifies what does not exist and the missaprehension which repudiates what does exist.


Reification is the notion that the imagined exists ultimately, and repudiation is the notion that the other 2 natures do not exist ultimately. For, the first exists only superficially, and the other 2 do not exist ultimately.

The relative is the non existance of the ultimately existant basis of designative verbal signs.

**Repuditation of relative actuality does not take the form 'it does not exist conventionally', nor the form 'generally it does not exist', but takes the form 'the ultimately existant is non-existant'**

### Procedures to negate both extremes

The extreme of reification is negated by showing that everything is ultimately empty with respect to ascriptive and descriptive designations.


> If the aggregates, such as form exist, it is possible to designate 'person'.  If held as non-existant
