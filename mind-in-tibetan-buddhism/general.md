## 7 Fold Division of Consciousness:

1. Direct Perceiver
1. Inferential Cognizer
1. Subsequent Cognizer
1. Correctly Assuming Consciousness
1. Awareness to which the object appears but is not ascertained
1. Doubting consciousness
1. Wrong consciousness


So the path is to move from wrong consciousness.. believing there is a self where this not one.. to having a direct perception of selflessness. The initial direct perception has great power to clear away the many loads of past misconception, but one needs to familiarize with it to get rid of all imprints of misconceptions.

Steps:

1. There is a wrong consciousness believing that a self does exist.
1. Then comes doubt thinking maybe the self doesn't exist
1. Then you develop a correctly assuming consciousness which definitely decides that there is no substantially existant self. At this point one holds the correct view. However, one has not yet realized selflessness. Although, the oral tradition describes the initial generation of correct assumption with regard to selflessness a powerful experience. It is now necessary to contemplate selflessness again and again, using reasoning, seeking to develop a certainty from which one cannot be shaken.
1. An inference is the end result of a specific process of reasoning. One establishes that if there were a substantially existant self it would have to exist in one of a limited number of ways, and that if it does not exist in one of those number of ways, it does not exist. Through reasoned investigation one comes to the conclusion that it does not exist in one of those ways and hence concludes that it does not exist. For this conclusion to have the force of reasoned conviction, one must go through the steps of this investigation over and over again, so that one is accustomed to it and thoroughly convinced of it. Onces conciousness throughtout this process of familiarization are correct assumptions; when this is brought to the point of unwavering certainty, one generates an inference. **With the generation of an inferential cognizer one could be said to have realized selflessness and to have incontrovertible knowledge of it.** However this is not the end of the process. At this point, ones realization is still conceptual, is till getting at selflessness by way of an image.
1. The goal is to develop ones realization more and more to the point of direct perception in which all need for an image has dissapeared and ones mental consciousness is able to contact its object directly; such direct perception of selflessness is the actual antidote, which upon extended cultivation is able to eradicate for ever the conception of self as well as all the other wrong views and afflictions that conceptions bring with it. Thereby making liberation from cyclic existance possible.

## Inference -> Direct Perception

The way in which an inference is transformed into a direct perception is just repeated familiarization with the object of meditation. Onces initial inference 


## 3 Fold Division

The division of awareness and knowers into 3 in terms of the object appearing to them. The three are:

1. Conceptual consciousness which take a meaning generality as their apprehended object
1. non-conceptual non-mistaken consciousness that takes a specifically charactarized phenomena as their apprehended object
1. non-conceptual mistaken consciousnesses which take clearly appearing non-existant as their apprehended object.

There are 4 main types of objects posited for consciousness:

1. object of engagement
1. determined object
1. appearing object
1. apprehended object

First 2 refer to the object that a consciuousness is actually getting at and understanding. However there is a qualification that the term `determined object` is used only for conceptual consciousnesses, whereas `object of engagement` is used for both conceptual and non-conceptual consciousnesses.

ex. The `object of engagement` of an eye consciousness apprehending blue is blue; both the `object of engagement` and the `determined object` of a `thought consciousness` thinking blue are blue.

The latter two types of objects - appearing and apprehended - refer to the object which is actually appearing to the consciousness and not necessarily to what it is comprehending.

Since the actual object that appears to a direct perception is what it realizes, its appearing object, apprehended object, and object of engagement are all the same.  -- in example of an eye consciousness apprehending blue, they are all blue.

For a conceptual consciousness apprehending blue, the object of engagement and determined object are the actual object the consciousness are understanding, the appearing object and apprehended object are just and image of blue, called a meaning generality.

This 3 fold division of consciousnesses centers on differences in the appearing, or apprehended, object of different consciousnesses. All thought consciousnesses necessarily take as their appearing object a meaning generality.

For a meaning generality, what appears is just the negation of all that is not the object. So all that is not pot appears. 

**The relative impoverishment of such an image in comparison to the richness of the appearance of the object involved in direct perception is the reason why direct perception is so much more highly valued than thought.** However, in order to understand things which we are now unable to perceive directly, we must rely on thought, for it provides the means to train the mind so that direct perception can eventually be developed. Thus in this system, although thought is finally trancended by direct perception, its importance as the means to that goal is recognized and valued.

Its a misconception that thought has no relation to the object. This fails to take into account the 2 types of objects of thought consciousness; all though that what appears to the object is indeed only an image, and not the actual object, the determined object of that consciousness, that which is understood through the image, is just that object itself. The negative nature of the image eliminates everything else and leaves as that to be realized just pot. Thus, thought is a reliable way to ascertain objects. 


The non-conceptual non-mistaken perceivers object is a specifically characterized phenomena. This object is impermanent. **Any impermanent phenomena is suitable to be the appearing object of a direct perceiver, but no permanent phenomena can, as the permanent appear only to thought.**
