# The Origin of Suffering

## Contemplating the process of cyclic existence in terms of its origin

This topic has 3 divisions:

1. How the obscuring afflictions arise
2. How that causes karma to be accumulated
3. The process of death and rebirth


## 1. How the obscuring afflictions arise

In order for cyclic existence to arise, -- in order to produce a samsaric rebirth -- karma and afflictions are necessary. **Of these 2, afflictions are the most important cause of such a rebirth.** Why? Because of if there are no obscuring afflictions, then even if you have accumulated incalcuable karmic seeds in the past, these karmas will not be able to ripen and yield results. 

The example of this are arhats and bodhisattvas who still have karmic seeds, but no afflictions. However, these karmas can not ripen, because the conditions needed for them to ripen.. the afflictions.. are absent. Those karmic potentials are like dry seeds, even if you have seeds, if they dont meet the correct conditions like moisture, they will not ripen. 

**All of the samsaric sufferings we have been describing -- birth, aging, and so forth -- cannot arise without these special conditions, even when the karmic seed has been planted.**

On the other hand, if the afflictions are there, then karma will immediately be created, and from that combination you will immediately take rebirth. **This is why we say that the afflictions are the primary cause of samsara.** Even if the karmic cause for rebirth in cyclic existence has not been created, once the afflictions are present you will create that karma.. then all of the conditions necessary for cyclic existence to arise will be present.

We have been contemplating the truth of the suffering of samsara so that we will generate a strong and powerful determination to escape from those sufferings. Of course, to escape you must get rid of the causes of samsara. As we have seen, out of the 2 causes, karma and the afflictions.. the afflictions are the most important.

**Therefore, the most important thing is to apply an antidote to those afflictions.**

In order to make use of a pwerful antidote, you must first identify the target that the antidote is indented to counteract. **Once you identify and understand the nature of the afflictions, you will find that some antidotes are useful to weaken them and temporarily supress them, while others are effective in eliminating them from the root. But it is always necessary to identify the enemy and then, recognizing when it arises, apply an effective antidote.**

Therefore, in order to master the obsuring afflictions there are 4 topiscs to consider:

1. Identifying the obscuring afflictions
2. The process of their production
3. The causes of the obscuring afflictions
4. The faults of the obscuring afflictions


### 1. Identifying the obscuring afflictions

```
An obscuring affliction is defined as a phenomenon which, when it arises, arises with the characteristic of being unsettling; and due to its arising the mental continuum becomes unsettled.

Asanga - Compendium of Knowledge
```

This is a general definition, which applies to all the obscuring afflictions as a class. 

**obscuring affliction - an inner mental event whose natures is to disturb or unsettle the mental state**

It's action or function is to create a restless, or non-tranquil mind. This is the general characteristic of all afflictions-- jealousy, pride, wrong view, hatred, desire, etc.

**Each one leads to mental disturbance, destorying mental peace and calmness. It always creates some kind of problem -- some kind of agitation in one direction or another. -- and it always brings a bad result.**

So here we will go over the 10 fundamental afflictions based on Asangas "Compendium of Knowledge"

### 1. Attachment

With attachment if you dont have the object, you want it, and if you have it, you dont want to seperate. 

Underlying attachment and the rest of the afflictions is a fundamentally incorrect way of perceiving the object. You see impure objects as pure, or impermanent objects as being permanent, or objects with a suffering nature as pleasurable.

Through the force of ignorance you impute characteristics onto the object; you superimpose attractive qualities (or in the case of hostility, repugnant qualities) that are not truly there. Then based on this mistaken perception, you grasp at the object and become attached to it. That ignorance, that wrong conception is the direct cause of your attachment or hostility.

### 2. Hostility

Hostility is a mind of ill will, directed toward a source of suffering, wanting to harm or destroy that object. The object of hostility is a source of ones own suffering. Whatever unhappiness you feel, or whatever causes that unhappiness can become an object of your anger and hatred.

Againg, the underlying cause of this affliction is the superimposition, stemming from ignorance, of qualities that are not there.

### 3. Pride

Pride is a mind that is puffed up and conceited; it comes from comparing yourself to others and viewing yourself as having superior qualities. Pride is based on the view of the transitory collection. Pride gives you a grander view of yourself by superimposing qualities on a self that does not in fact exist the way you perceive it.

### 4. Ignorance

Ignorance means lacking the direct realization of the truth, not seeing reality as it is, not knowing the nature of ultimate truth. This ignorance holds to a true, inherently existent self.

**This ignornace is the root of all obscuring afflictions.**

This ignorance leads to all kinds of incorrect conceptions. **When you grasp at objects through the lens of these misconceptions, desire, attachment, hostility, and all the other afflictions naturally emerge. The ignorance that grasps at a mistaken conception of self is the fundamental root of them all.**


### 5. Doubt

Doubt is an attitude of wondering whether the 4 noble truths, the cause and effect of karma, and the three Jewels are true or not.  The affliction of doubt implies one is leaning toward the wrong conclusion, thinking "This is probably not true" or "This probably does not exist"

This kind of doubt always undermines the kind of faith, confidence, and certainty that is vital to have if you are to acheive emancipation.

--- 

**These are the first 5 rudimentary afflictions. In the presentation of 6 obscuring afflictions. The 6th is wrong view. Here in the presentation of 10. Wrong view is divided into 5 distinct erroneos views.**

All of these views are described as forms of what is known as 'afflictive wisdom.' The 'wisdom' referred to here is the mental factor whose function is to discriminate or distinguish the object before it and thereby to determine its qualities. In this regard, each of these 5 views is a form of wisdom, but in this case it is mistaken or wrong. Instead of leading to purification and happiness, it leads to further affliction and suffering. Since it leads to further affliction it is called 'afflictive wisdom'.

---

### 6. The View of the Transitory Aggregates

This is an afflictive wisdom that, based on observing the appropriating aggregates, grasps at an inherently existent "I" and "mine". **This discriminating mind takes the aggregates, or some portion of the aggregates, as its object. Then, based on observing that conventional object, it imputes an inherently existent "I" -- a self that exists inherently.** Grasping onto that inherently existing I, the mind goes on to impute all kinds of other objects, such as such as aggregates, which are held to be inherent existing "mine" -- inherently belonging to or apart of the self. 

The view of transitory aggregates is grasping as self of persons... not grasping at self of phenomena.

So then the question arises, what about those things that are considered 'mine', and are apparantly not the person ... like 'my nose' .. is this included under the view of transitory aggregates?

Jetsunpa says that yes it is, because it is grasping at a self of persons. For there to be 'mine', there has to be an 'I' first. Grasping at an inherently existent "my nose", can only be done by first thinking "me". Therefore this type of grasping is grasping at a self of persons.

Afflictive wisdom grasps onto "I" and "mine" and experiences them as inherently existent when in fact they are merely imputed by the mind. They exist only as imputations that arise based on observing the aggregates.

This mistaken view that grasps at "I" and "mine" as inherently existent is called the view of the *transitory* collections because the aggregates are constantly perishing, moment by moment. It is a view of transitory *collections* because the aggregates are a combination of many different mental and physical phenomena that come together and are constantly evolving.  **Thus, the name of this wrong view is pointing directly at the impermanent, perishible aggregates, and emphasizing that they are not inherently existent things.**

The self of "I", is nothing but an imputation arising from looking at the aggregates.

This does *not* mean that there is no self at all. Conventionally, the aggregates do arise in dependence on causes and conditions, and we do conventionally speak of our own mind body continuum as a "self". **But this self is an imputation, and does not exist the way the view of the transitory collections mistakenly holds it to exist.**

**The self that is projected by the view of the transitory aggregates is non-existent. It is the non-existence of that "inherently existent" self that we try to realize when we meditate on the emptiness of the conventional self.**

Once you grasp onto that false conception of self, that self naturally becomes the center of all your concern and attention, you "self-centered view". From there, all other afflictions emerge. You become attached to this self, and become attached to things belonging to this self which you view as "mine". You imagine a large separation between those things that are "I" and 'mine' and all other beings and phenomena. Then anger an hatred arise when the "I" is frustrated and the 'mine' is not respected. **And so it goes.**


### 7. The view holding to extremes

This is an afflictive wisdom that observing the self as perceived by the transitory collections, seeing it either as permanent, or as something that will not take a future rebirth after this life. 

These are the 2 extreme views:
1. viewing the self as eternal
2. not beleiving that, due to karma, there will be future rebirths

Many people beleives that the physical body dies, but there is an eternal and imperishable soul. This is the extreme of permanence.

Others believe that the phsyco-physical being that is present here right now is all there is all there is, and once this being dies all traces of it are permanently extinguished. This of course means that there is no rebirth.. no cycling through samsara. No going beyond samsara, no nirvana, no buddhahood. This is the extreeme nihilistic view because it holds that after death there is non-existence.

### 8. Esteeming unworthy views

This is the afflictive wisdom that observes either the view of the transitory collections, the view holding to extremes, or wrong view, together with the aggregates upon which the views are based, and holds these mistaken views to be superior and excellent .. ie *right view*


### 9. Esteeming mistaken morality and asceticism

An afflictive wisdom that holds that various misguided religious practices are superior and lead toward emancipation. 

### 10. Wrong view

Of course all 4 views above are wrong views, but here wrong view specifically means the nihilistic view that denies the existence of previous and future lives or the cause and effect of karma. In general, when we are speaking of wrong view we are refering to the nihilistic view that holds to the nonexistence of karma and rebirth, because that is the biggest obstacle to practice and progress on the path.





### 2. The Process of Their Production

Now we have identified the 10 primary afflictions, we look into the sequential process that gives rise to them. After that we will examine the causes, and then their faults.

There are 2 systems explaining this process, depending on whether ignorance is taken to be a seperate affliction from the view of the transitory collections, or whether they are considered to be identical.

The first system, held by Asanga and Vasubhandu, held that ignorance was a general mental dullness, while in contrast, the view of the transitory collections is an afflictive wisdom, a mistaken discrimination. Later the yogacarins, under Dharmakirti, as well as Madhyamikas, held that ignorance and the view of the transitory aggregates were one and the same thing. 

To illustrate the first view, imagine you are walking on a dark and murky path, and you see a coiled, rope, but a mistaken thought arises 'This is a snake'. Once you apprehend a snake, other thoughts and emotions naturally follow, such as fear, hatred, and so forth.

**In the same way, because of the obscuring darkness of ignorance, we cannot see the tru nature of the aggregates clearly.** In the darkness, we miscontrue that psycho-physical continuum to be a substantial self. From that mistaken view of the aggregates -- from apprehending those changing collections to be a substantial, unitary self -- all the other afflictions naturally emerge.

According to the second system of explanation, ignorance and the view of the transitory collections are identical. **In that case, the view of the transitory aggregates is itself the root of the other afflictions**. Once you hold the aggregates to be an inherently existent self, tht misconception becomes the basis for the self-centered attitude that makes the distinction between self and other. **What is "I" and "mine" is seen as essential distinct from everything else, which is 'other'**. Once you have made that distinction, you develop **attachment** and feel beneficially inclined toward everything that is on your side. **Hostility arises toward everything not on your side.** **Pride** develops from grasping at the self and feeling that what is 'mine' is superior and more worthy of support than what is 'other'.

You observe that self, and you come to see it either as eternal and having an indestructable essence, or you belive that it is nothing more than what is immediately present and that it is subject to complete extinction at the time of death. These are the grasping at the erroneous views of **holding on to extremes**. You come to admire these wrong views of the self that you hold, and at the same time you pursue varios harmful practices and behaviors that from from those views; in this way both **esteeming unworthy views** and **esteeming mistaken morality and asceticism** arise.

In the same way you develop **wrong view**, denying Buddha -- the teacher who taught selflessness -- along with his teachings on karma, rebirth, the 4 noble truths, and the three jewels, including the highest attainment of buddhahood and the path leading to that attainment.

**We can see how these various afflictions arise from the fundamental error of holding to a substantial self.**

```
Holding there is a self, you conceive of other.
Discriminating self and other, attachment and hostility arise.
In connection with these,
All the faults arise.

Dharmakirti  - Compendium of Valid Cognition
```

It is from the 3 poisons -- attachment, hostility, and ignorance that all the other afflictions are created.

Each afflictions can become the motivating thought for actions of body, speech, and mind. Any action whether virtuous or non-virtuous, that is impelled by one of these afflictions is **contaminated action**.

**The accumulation of that contaminated action, or karma becomes the potential that ripens into future experience.** That karma determines the nature of your life in the future. It determines your rebirth, and the quality of experience of your life in that realm. Therefore, we can say that all samsaric results arise from those 3 poisons, and that the ignorance of grasping at an inherently existent self is the root of all cyclic existence. That is what Dharmakirti is saying here.

The practioner comes to realize that cyclic existence is not some externally created condition, but is actually an internal process; it arises from the root of ignorance. **By looking inward, watchin in meditation, you can observe this process, and by so doing the arising of afflictions and the way they motivate each action become clearer and clearer. You can see how each moment arises out of this nexus of cause and effect.**

You can see that even virtous actions, there is some attachment to a self and there is some seeking of gratification for this self, and the action will bring some benefit to the self. 

In addition, ignorance pervades all the afflictions.

```
Just as the tactile faculty pervades the body,
Ignorance pervades the afflictions.
Therefore by vanquishing ignorance,
All the afflictions will be vanquished.

400 Stanzas
```

Ignorance is the fundamental, root affliction, pervading all of the others. From that mistaken grasping at a self, all the others arise. **By observing them in meditation, you come to recognize how they perform their destructive functions; you will be observing exactly what the enemy is doing.**

This is the operation of wisdom. Practioners dont look outside of themselves for the enemy. They are always attending to the inner enemy, examining who they are and what kind of harm they are doing. 

If you watch these 6 inner enemies in this way, you will soon develop the capacity to resist their influence and prevent them from leading you to harmful actions.  **Even if you cannot immediatly resist all negative behaviors, simply developing an awareness of what the afflictions are and how they function will be of great long term benefit.** 

```
Standing at the door of the afflictions, holding the spear of the antidotes -- other than that I have no other job.

Kadampa Geshe Ben Kungyal
```

**All you need to do is guard the door against afflictions**

Your job is to use your wisdom to watch the door of the mind and ask:

- What is it doing?
- What is it planning to do?
- What is coming in?
- How is it reacting?

If you are diligent in this , you will be successful. As you gain control over these inner enemies.. you will find that you are naturally controlling the outer enemies -- the sufferings you experience in cyclic existence -- because they are the results of the inner enemies, the obscuring afflictions. 

**To destroy the afflictions from the root will ultimately require the direct realization of emptiness.** Until you reach this higher realization.. you can use many methods to block, suppress, and resist the influence of the afflictions. 

You can recognize the conditions that give rise to certain afflictions, and avoid those situations. 

**Realizing that you are mistaking impure objects as pure, you can turn that perception around by mditatin on the contaminated nature of all objects of desire.**

You can use methods to mitigate the intensity of afflictions such as desire or anger when they arise. This lessens their influence and gives you the mental space to avoid creating strong negative karma. Beyond that, if you cultivate a high degree of mental stabilization you can temporarily supress the afflictions, and this will be very helpful as you progress on the path to the final realization of emptiness. which will eliminate these afflictions from the root.

**In order to engage in any of these methods for avoiding or suppressing the afflictions, you need to identify them and understand how they come to arise. For that purpose, in the next section we examine their causes.**


### 3. The Causes of the Obscuring Afflictions

All of the afflictions arise from a combination of various causes. Six of the fundamental causes are explained here.

### 1. Basis

The basis of the afflictions is their latent status as a *subtle propensity.* This means that even though an affliction, desire for ex. is not currently active in the mindstream, it is continuously abiding at an unconscious level as a potentiality, a seed, a subtle propensity. Until this propensity is removed from the root, there remains in every sentient being this readiness for a particular affliction to arise when conducive objects and conditions are met. This potentiality is the **basis or support of the obsuring afflictions.**

### 2. Object

**The object causing an affliction to arise is the conducive condition that awakens the subtle propensity into a fully active affliction.**

Just how for a dry seed to sprout and grow into a flower, all sentient beings have in them the seed or subtle propensity for the afflictions to blossom, and when a suitable object is encountered it acts as the supporting condition enabling the affliction to arise in full flower.

In general we say an affliction arises when:

1. it has not been eliminated from the root
2. the object is nearby
3. you perceive the object erroneously - although the object is impure and has the nature of causing suffering, you view it as pure and cause of pleasure.

Like for ex. there is the propensity for attachment to arise, and the object a girls body comes into proximity, you then perceive that body as attractive, even though its nature is impure and the cause of suffering, you view it as pure and pleasurable. **Based on that misperception of the proximate object, the active affliction of attachment arises.**

**Since an object is necessary for an affliction to arise, you can avoid the afflictions by avoiding the objects that give rise to them. You can intentionally avoid situations where you know you will meet those objects. This is a simple method that can be very helpful.**


### 3. Social Distraction

This refers to those worldy activites that bring you under the influence of unwholesome acquantances. When you spend time with peoples whose minds are completely distracted by drinking, playing games, and wasting time, this naturally contributes to the development of afflictions such as attachment, hatred, jealousy, pride, and so forth. 

**One day, or even a couple hours can agitate your mind for days or even weeks after. It stirs up and excites the afflictions and makes it quite difficult to regain control of your mind.**

At a later stage of spiritual development - once you have realized the truth of selflessnes to some degree - your inner resolve will not be effected by the external influences of worldly distractions. You will be protected by your own inner wisdom.

But for now, at the beginning of the path, you possess all these inner propensities, like seeds in the spring, just waiting to meet the moisture and warmth that will enliven them and cause them to send out shoots. At that stage of development, you need the protection of these external precautions.

### 4. Explanation

This refers to listening to various kinds of wrong or harmful teachings, or reading books that lead your mind in the wrong direction. If you listen to teachings that encourage you to commit harmful actions, or read things that stimulate desire or hatred, that will obviously lead you away from the goal of pacifying and eliminating the afflictions.

### 5. Becoming accustom

means that by repeating certain behaviors over a long period of time, without applying an antidote, you become habituated to those actions, and they become your natural, ordinary, and daily way of life.

### 6. Attention

This refers to incorrect thinking. Imputing onto objects qualities that they do not have. Prime examples of this are imputing: attractiveness onto objects that have un unpleasant character, purity onto the impure, and permanence onto things that are impermanent. For example, if there is a person you dont like, someone who is unnattractive to you, you impute all kind of negative qualities onto that person.. giving all kinds of false reasons why that person is ugly and horrible. **This is the process by which you build up a powerful and very destructive hatred.** In the same way, you can build up a very powerful attachment by thinking about how wonderful and attractive something is. **Imputing onto others these 'good' and 'bad' qualities and then concentrating on them cause attachment and aversion to arise in a very powerful form.** The afflictions wil increase and strengthen to the exten that you indulge in this kind of deluded attention.

--

**These 6 points are called the "causes of the obscuring afflictions." In order to eliminate these afflictions from the root, you must directly realize the emptiness of self. The non-existence of the self as it is held by the view of the transitory collections. That is the main antidote to the afflictions, but until you can realize that, it is very helpful to understand these causes and conditions that give rise to afflictions. That way, you can steer away from these causes and conditions and pacify the afflictions until you are able to eradicate them completely.**



### 4. The Faults of the Obscuring Afflictions

**The afflictions always bring bad results; they never have any good effects. As soon as an affliction arises it disturbs your mind and causes you to perceive the object of attention in a distorted manner.**

It reinforces, solidifies, and perpetuates the subtle propensities that are already present.

When an affliction arises, other afflictions that are of the same nature can also increase. For ex. when there is desire, other types of desire can be stimulated.

When afflictions arise they first harm you, then they can harm others when you act on it. **All of the afflictions lead to misdeeds now and in future lives.** All the actions you perform motivated by the afflictions will ripen into unpleasant experiences in this and future lives.

**Because of these afflictions and negative karma you spend vast periods of time trapped in miserable lives and emancipation is pushed far away.**

You dont function well in from of the other people and in public. You feel nervous, hesitant, joyless, and discouraged when you are in public. You lack the fearlessness that comes with a controlled mind. 

When your time to die arrives, you go with great regret and sorrow. you have only your negative actions to recall. And after death your are born into the worst realms of existence. You strive for peace, happiness, and freedom, but you get none of these.. you actually get their opposite.

**Ordinarily we think of other beings as our enemies. But this is not true.. the real enemy is inside.. these obscuring afflictions...**

**First you realize that other beings are not the source of your problem, the real enemy is inside. These afflictions are the real source of danger and all the suffering you experience. How can you destroy them? What is the method? This attitude of focusing your energy on destorying the afflictions takes on the form of hatred, but it is not hatred in th eusual sense; it is the practice of liberating yourself from delusion.**

*quote from shantideva about how the real enemy is the afflictions since they have so much destructive power*

Why are these afflictions the proper objects of your hatred? If all the beings of this world rose up against you what is the worst they could do? They could kill you, in other words, seperate you from this life. But that is not too serious of a thing. After all, this seperating is going to happen anyway. And the beings of this world cannot do anything to you after you are dead. They can't put you into the hot fire of hell.

**But the inner enemy.. these powerful obscuring afflictions, can cast you right into a fire so intense that it could incinerate the greates mountain in the world.** The distance between you and that suffering is not at all great, it is only the distance of a single breath. It is not merely birth in hell, but all the other miseries of this samsaric world -- poverty, illness, grief, and the rest -- that are brought about by this inner enemy.

From the point of view of time aswell, the afflictions surpass all other types of enemies. No other external enemy could harm you for longer than the length of this one lifetime. But this inner enemy has been operating since beginningless time, and will continue to bring you misery until you are able to uproot it.

With regular enemies, if you turn it around and benefit them they will turn into friends, but it is not this way with the afflictions. 

Until you have succesffully applied the antidotes, this is the way that they will operate. **The more you cooperate with attachment, hostility, jealosy, or pride, the more suffering they will bring you.**

But there is one good thing about the afflictions.. if you combatt them, and succeed in casting them out of your mind, they will never come back. Once you eliminate afflictions from the root, there is no wy from them to return. When they are eliminated from the mind, there is no other place for them to go. **By your application of the inner antidote -- the realization of the true nature of the self -- the obscuring afflictions are permanent terminated. That is the kind os cessation you need to obtain.**

**Once you understand these faults of the afflictions, you must determine to combat them using the methods that are made available here**

```
In order to eliminate these afflictions you must know their faults, their nature, their antidotes, and what causes their arising. Once you understand their disadvantages, view them as completely faulty, and regard them as enemies. Therefore you should contemplate this matter as it is explained in the Ornament for the Mahayana Sutras and Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds. (quotes from these 2 are on pg 283)

Gonpawa
```

He then goes on to say:

```
In order to understand the characteristics of the obscuring afflictions, study the abhidharma. Atleast study Vasubhandu's 'Explanation of the Five Aggregates'. Once you are familiar with the root afflictions, and the subsidiariy afflictions, as soon as attachment, hostility, or any of the others appear in your mind, you will be able to identify it with the thought "This is one of those; now it has arisen."  and you will be able to combat it.

Gonpawa
```

Study the abhidharma texts by Vasubandu and Asanga. **First you must know what the afflictions are, and be able to recognize them when they arise.** You need to know everything about these internal enemies in order to be able to destory them. Just like in war you need to know everything about your enemy. This is why we explain this subject in such detail. You first need to educate yourself equip yourself, and then you can engage in the struggle to oppose and eliminate the forces that do you so much harm.

## B. How That Causes Karma to be Accumulated

In this section we will look at  the way those afflictions cause karma to be accumulated.

This has 2 parts:

1. Identifying the karma that is accumulated
2. How karma is accumulated


### 1. Identifying the karma that is accumulated

This topic has 2 parts:

1. Karma that is intention
2. Karma that is intended action

What is the meaning of karma? Karma is explained in 2 aspects. 

**Karma that is intention** - the mental intention that motivates a physical or verbal action. On the basis of this motivation, an action is actually performed.

**Karma that is intended action** - There are 2 systems of thought regarding the meaning of this type of karma. 

The lower abhidharma system by Vasubandu holds that this karma is the actual physical action of body or speech that is motivated by intention. For these schools,this type of karma is a physical action.

In the Mahayana abhidharma system presented by Asanga in the Compedium of Knowledge, karma is always mental. So here, the karma is the thought - mental action - that accompanies the physical or verbal action motivated by the intention. **Although there is a physical act, that does not constitute the karma; instead, karma is the purely mental action that accompanies the physical one.**


### 1. Karma that is intention

```
What is intention? It is is a function of consciousness that is a mental action initiating the engagement of the mind in virtuous, nonvirtuous, and neutral activities.

Asanga Compendium of Knowledge
```
Whatever physical or verbal action you perform, there is always a virtuous, nonvirtuous, or neutral motivation that lies behind it, intending it and initiating it. **That is the karma that is intention, or intention karma.**

**Intention is a mental factor whose function is to move and induce the primary mind with which it is concomitant toward an object.**

The primary mind is said to be similar to the hand, and the mental factors are like the individual fingers.

The wholesome or unwholesome nature of the primary mind is determined by the presence of wholesome or unwholesome mental factors. **If an unwholesome mental factor is present, the entire mind becomes unwholesome. In the same way that a pinch of salt added to water causes a salty flavor to pervade every drop of water.**

In each cognitive action the *primary mind* apprehends the basic presence of the object. The mental factor of **feeling** experiences the object as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. The mental factor of **discrimination** identifies the object by discerning its individual characteristics. The mental factor of **intention** (ie karma) directs and propels the mind towards the object and moves the mind to become invloved with that object. **Just as a magnet moves a peice of nearby iron, intention moves the mind toward engagement with beneficial or harmful objects.**. The mental factor of **contact** acts to connect the three elements of a cognition: the object, faculty, and primary mind. This coming together of the three activates the sensory or mental faculty such that it becomes the basis for feeling of pleasure, pain, and indifference. Lastly the mental factor of **attention** focuses and stabilizes the mind on its object, not allowing it to move elsewhere.

here explains the 5 characteristics shared by primary mind and mental factors.

### 2. Karma that is Intended Action

According to Vasubandhu's Treasury of Knowledge, karma that is intended action is any action of body and speech motivated by an intention. In this system, intended karma is the actual physical or verbal action initiated by intention karma.

```
Karma is intention and what it produces.
Intention is mental karma.
What it gives rise to  is karma of the body and speech.

Treasury of Knowledge
```

The Vaibhasikas also divided this physical and verbal karma into two types: **revealing** and **non-revealing** karma. A karma is revealing if it allows others to see ones intention. So when you do something with your body or speech others can see or hear it and see the intention. 

**Non-revealing karma** is the ongoing karmic potentiality that is instigated or set in motion by that physical, revealing action of body or speech. It is the form in which the karma persists in the psycho-physical continuum. Although it is form -- a material substance based on the four great elements - it is supremely subtle, invisible, and even non-obstructive. **This is the Vaibhasika view of the way karma persists in the continuum of an individual.** Proponents of this view say that both revealing and non revealing karma are form; they are physical. This conception of revealing and nonrevealing karma was on of the key concepts in the Vaibhasika karmic system that Vasubandhu criticizes and tries to refute. He rejected the notion that karma was in any way physical.

The Sautrantika, Yogacara, and Madhyamaka schools maintain that intended karma is the **thought** that accompanies the action at the time of performing the action. They insist that **the mind is the thing**; physical action is not in and of itself karma.

For ex with killing.

First there is an intention to kill, which sets in motion a second thought, a second intention, that actually moves the body during the action of killing. **It is that thought which moves the body at the time of the action, that constitues the intended karma.** In the case of an action of speech, it is the thought that moves the voice at the time of the act that constitues the karma of speech; it is not the sound, or the physical movement that makes the sound. 

It all depends on the intention that lies behind the physical action, and not the physical action itself. For this reason, the upper schools insist that karma is mental. **First there is intention karma which sets the action into motion, and then there is intended karma - which moves the body or voice at the time of the action.**


### Virtuous and Nonvirtuous Karma

Virtuous karma can be subdivided into 2:

1. contaminated Virtuous karma
1. uncontaminated Virtuous karma

In general, contaminated phenomena are those that nourish or increase afflictive states of mind -- that is, states that lead to suffering and do not lead to liberation. Contaminated karma is basically action that is motivated by the obscuring afflictions. This is action that is rooted in affliction and, once it is performed, that nourishes future afflictions.

Contaminated karma is also of 2 types, that which exists in the mind of an arya, and that which exists in the mind of an ordinary individual. We will look at arya later.

**Basically, cyclic existence is produced by contaminated action performed by ordinary individuals, and that is what we will focus on here.**

There is also another way to divide karma:

1. meritorious - virtuous karma of the desire realm - only in desire realm
2. demeritorious - non-virtuous karma of the desire realm. All non virtious karma happens in the desire realm. So all nonvirtious karma is demeritiourious
3. immoveable - contaminated virtuous karma of the form and formless realms

```
Meritorious karma is virtuous karma of the desire realm.
Immoveable karma is karm in the upper realms

Why is it called immoveable? In the desire realm where we live, virtious and non virtuous karma are moveable or variable. For ex. if you create a virtuous karma that should bear fruit as a result in a birth in a deva realm, under certain conditions, the result of that karma could change to birth in another realm, perhaps a lower realm or as a human. However in the form and formless realms, when you create karma that should ripen in some particular level, it will never ripen in another level - it doesnt change. 

```
Why? Because karma that should ripen in one level
Does not move to another level.

## 2. How Karma is Accumulated




.. lost all notes here... :(

We can say that all of our actions are done in order to find happiness. Some kind of mental happiness or physical pleasure. Nobody is trying to obtain suffering. Although we constantly create karma that is the cause of suffering, nobody is creating karma with the intention of producing suffering for themselves. Therefore, we can understand the process of accumulating karma in two categories:

1. Accumulating karma for pleasant feelings
2. Accumulating karma for neutral feelings
3. 

## a. Accumulating karma for pleasant feelings

### i. Accumulating karma for the pleasure that comes from enjoying desirable objects: Sights, sounds, and the like

Here we are mainly talking about sensual pleasure: the pleasurable experience of form, sounds, taste, smell, or touch. Most of the pleasures of the desire realm, which include the 3 lower realms, humans, and the desire realm devas  - are sensual pleasures. **In the desire realm, most karma is accumulated in the effort to achieve some type of sensual enjoyment.**

**There are two types of action intended to achieve sensual pleasure. If you object is to acheive sensual pleasure only in this lifetime, then you are mainly accumulating non meritourious karma. In contrast, if you are mainly seeking pleasure for a future life, you are accumulating meritorious karma -- such as observing ethical conduct, giving charity, and practicing patience. When your concern is only for this life, even when you try to practice virtue, by meditating, making offerings, etc. there is actually no virtuous intent because you are acting only for the sake of immediate pleasure. Therefore your actions are demeritorious karma** 

There is a Kadampa saying that goes, "If circumambulate merely for the sake of this life, it will become cause of birth in hellp, the hungry ghosts, or the animals."

### ii. Accumulating karma for gaining bliss in the meditative concentration, after you have rejected attachments to external sensual pleasures

Thus far we have been talking about pleasure coming from external objects. For the devas of the form and formless realms. Such beings are not attracted to sensual pleasure. It seems so coarse to them that it feels almost like suffering. The pleasure they enjoy comes from meditative concentration. This is much deeper and more subtle than externally based pleasure.

This type of bliss here is the special kind of mental happiness that is experienced in the first 3 concentrations of the form realm. When meditators reach these higher levels of meditative states, they are accumulating immoveable karma, and that karma becomes the cause for them to be reborn in one of the first 3 levels of the form realm.

## b. Accumulating karma for neutral feelings

When you have turned away from attachment to sensual pleasure, and on top of that you have lost interest in mental happiness of meditative bliss, you may engage in activities for the purpose of experiencing neutral feelings. Then you will be accumulating immoveable karma that will be the cause for rebirth in the 4th concentration up through the formless absorptions and their highest level: the peak of existence.

---

This explanations follows the though of Vasubandhu accoerding to his *Treasury of Knowledge* and its autocommentary. 

**The key to this system is understanding the following: those beings who accumulate karma for the sake of sensual pleasure are born in the desire realm; those beings who accumulate karma for the sake of meditative bliss are born in the first three levels of the form realm; and those beings who accumulate karma for the sake of neutral feeling of the deepest meditative absorption are born from the fourth concentration up to the peak of existence.**

Tsongkhapa then takes this to its logical conclusion. All of these beings are creating a particular type of karma in their quest to experience some form of happiness and freedom from suffering. Because of their attachment to those gross and sublt levels of pleasure, their karma becomes the cause of future rebirth in cyclic existence. **However, if you reverse that logic: if you feel nothing but revulsion for samsara - from the hell realms up to the peak of existence - and you engage in virtuous actions purely for the sake of acheiving complete freedom from samsaric experience all together, you will leave cyclic existence further and futher behind and emancipation will grow nearer and nearer.**

With this topic we have concluded the discussion of karma in the Lam Rim Chenmo

**By studying thinking about, and meditating on the details of karma, you can integrate your understanding with your way of life, and this will create a solid foundation for progress on the path.**
