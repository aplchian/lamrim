## How to learn the bodhisattva deeds are developing the spirit of enlightenment

This has 3 parts:

1. The reason why you must learn the trainings after developing the spirit of enlightenment
2. Demonstrating that you will not become a buddha by learning either method or wisdom
3. Explanation of the process of learning the precepts

### 1. The reason why you must learn the trainings after developing the spirit of enlightenment

To relieve others sufferings, the thought is not enough, you must actually work to achieve it. To accomplish others welfare you must first train and discipline yourself first.  Practice is said to be learning the trainings in the precepts associated with the Bodhisattva vows after you have taken them. 

### 2. Demonstrating that you will not become a buddha by learning either method or wisdom

You must engage in the method to actually achieve enlightenment. To achieve the result you must rely on an unmistaken complete set of causes and conditions. 

So what is the complete set of causes and conditions?

```
`Lord of Secrets, the sublime wisdom of omniscience comes from compassion as its root. It comes from the spirit of enlightenment as it’s cause. It is brought to completion by method. 
```
`
The goal is to achieve non-abiding nirvana. To achieve this, you must achieve non-abiding in cyclic existence via the wisdom that knows reality, contingent on the path of wisdom. You also have to achieve the non-abiding peace that is nirvana via the wisdom that understand the diversity of phenomena, contingent on the path of method. 

```
`With the knowledge of wisdom, you eliminate all afflictions. With the knowledge of method, you include all living beings.

Question of Sky Treasure Sutra
```
`
When you are on the path, right from the time of wanting the goal of buddhahood — your must depend on both method and wisdom; you will not attain it by either alone.

```
`There perfection of wisdom is the mother. Skill-in-means is the Father.
```
`
On the path you must induce without any contradiction:

1.  certain knowledge of the total freedom from any elaboration of the conception of signs of true existence in 2 kinds of self with respect to even a particle of a mental object
2. certain knowledge that “this comes from that”, and “This has this good quality or fault”

This in turn is how you determine the 2 truths, the philosophical view of what exists.  

You are counted as a person who “knows the 2 truths truths and has found the conquerors intent” if you are connived that the following two valid cognitions not only do not, of course, harm each other, but rather aide each other: 

1. the valid cognition that establishes the ultimate, which is determined through scripture and reasoning to be the absence of even a particle of essential nature in the way of being or ontological status of any phenomenon of cyclic existence or nirvana
2. the conventional valid cognition that establishes that causes and effects, in their diverse workings, are certain, without any confusion of even the slightest cause or effect


It is in the nature of dependent arising that results are made in accordance with their causes. Buddha hood has been causes.

```
`O friends! The bodies of tathagatas are produced from hundreds of meritorious deeds, from all virtues, from immeasurable virtuous paths!

Teaching of Vimalakirti
```
`
```
`When the causes of even a buddha’s embodiment of form
Have no measure, as with the world,
How then can their be a measure
Of the causes of the embodiment of truth?
