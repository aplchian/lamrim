### 1. What Meditative Stabilization is

**Meditative stabilization is a virtuous, one-pointed state of mind that stays fixed on its object of meditation without distraction to other things**

```
It is the one-pointed state of mind-- stabilized on virtue, and either mundane or supramundane -- of bodhisattvas who have first studied and reflected on the bodhisattvas scriptural collections. Whether it is oriented toward meditative serenity, toward insight, or toward both as the path that conjoins them, understand that this one-pointed state of mind is the bodhisattva's meditative stabilization. 

Asanga - Bodhisattva Bhumis
```

```
Having thus generated joyous perseverance,
Set your mind in meditative concentration

Shantideva
```

### 2. How to begin the cultivation of meditative stabilization

Think over the benefits of meditative stabilization and the faults of not cultivating it. I will explain this in the meditative serenity section.

### 3. The divisions of meditative stabilization

In line with the above citation from Asanga, if you subdivide meditative stabilization according to:

according to nature: 
1. mundane
1. supramundane

according to orientation: 
1. serenity
1. insight
1. both conjoined

according to function: 
1. **meditative stabilization that stabilizes mind and body in bliss within this life** - meditative stabilizations that generate mental and physical pliancy when you enter them with equipose
1. **meditative stabilization that achieves good qualities** - meditative stabilizations which accomplish good qualities shared with the shravakas - the superknowledges, liberations, totalities, masteries, etc.
1. **meditative stabilization that carries out the welfare of living beings** - meditative stabilization that accomplishes the eleven activites for others welfare

### 4. How to practice

Whenever you practice any virtuous meditative stabilization you do so in association with the six supremacies and all 6 perfections. The generosity of meditative stabilization is maintaining meditative stabilization yourself and then establishing others in it. Understand the other perfections from earlier explanation.

### 5. A summary

The recollection and the cultivation of the spirit of enlightenment -- the basis of the bodhisattva deeds-- is what inspires you to train in order to set all living beings in uncontaminated meditative stabilization. After you have increased the stability of this spirit, aspire to the high meditative stabilizations and train in these. Even if you are unable to fully develop the stabilizations, you must strive to train from time to time in one-pointed concentration to whatever extent you are able.

**If you do not do so, you will be continually stained with the fault of breaking the precepts, and in other lives as well you will find it most difficult to learn the trainings for entering the many doors of the bodhisattva's meditative stabilization.** 

**Whereas, if you never give up your effort, even in this like your mind will become steadily less distracted, making your accumulations of virtues very powerful. In future lives you will have physical and mental bliss and a joyful mind, thereby easily completing the perfection of meditative stabilization.**


## How to Train in the Perfection of Wisdom

5 parts:

1. What wisdom is
1. How to begin the generation of wisdom
1. The divisions of wisdom
1. How to practice
1. A summary

### 1. What wisdom is

In general, wisdom is what thoroughly discerns the ontological status of the object under analysis, but in this context wisdom refers to proficiency in the five topics of knowledge and the like.

```
Know that bodhisattva's wisdom is the thorough analysis of phenomena that engages or has engaged all of what is to be known and that operates through focusing on the five topics of knowledge -- Buddhist knowledge, grammar, logic, technical arts, and medicine. 

Asanga Bodhisattva Levels
```

Here, the wisdom that "engages" refers to wisdom prior to attaining the bodhisattva levels; wisdom that "has engaged" refers to wisdom after attaining such levels.


### 2. How to begin the generation of wisdom

The way to begin the generation of wisdom is to contemplate the benefits of generating wisdom and the faults of not generating it. The benefits and faults of having or lacking the wisdom of `selflessness` will be explained later, so here he will discuss the remaining types a little.

With respect to indicating wisdom's benefits, wisdom is the root of all good qualities for this and future lives.

```
Wisdom is the root of all good qualities,
Seen and not yet seen.
To achieve both of these,
Embrace wisdom.

The great source of what you seek
And for liberation is knowledge.
So, esteeming it from the start,
Adhere to wisdom, the great mother.

Nagarjuna 'Hundred Verses on Wisdom'
```

Wisdom functions like an eye for the other 5 perfections.

If the gold ornament of the 5 perfections from generosity to meditative stabilization is adorned with wisdom, which is able to distinguish right from wrong, they become more magnificent, because wisdom makes them much purer. 

```
The merits of generosity and so forth
Are more powerful with wisdom as their lord,
Just as an array of fine gold jewelry
Shines more brightly when inset with jewels.

It is this wisdom that renders vast
The capacity for virtue in the purpose of each one,
Just as the mind's additional power clearly displays
The respective objects of the sensory faculties.

Aryasura 'Compendium of Perfections'
```

Similarly, wisdom is also crucial for other faculties such as faith and so on. When wisdom is present as lord, your generosity, faith, etc, understand well the merit of virtue and the faults of stinginess and so forth, so you will become skilled at eliminating afflictions and increasing good qualities.

Bodhisattvas depend on wisdom to purify the other 5 perfections. If when they give their flesh to someone who asks for it, they are unaffected by such thoughts as pride, discouragement, etc. It is as though they were taking a cut from a medicinal plant. **This is because their wisdom makes reality manifest.**

**With the wisdom that sees the trouble of both cyclic existence and the peace of nirvana, they accomplish ethical discipline for the sake of others welfare, so they practice pure ethical discipline.**

**Through wisdom they know the faults of impatience and the merits of patience, and they then discipline their minds so they are not over powered by suffering and others misperceptions of them.** 

**With wisdom they understand well everything at which they joyously persevere, so their perseverance brings great success on the path.**

**And through wisdom based on reasoning they accomplish the supreme delight and bliss of the meditative stabilization that is fixed upon the meaning of reality.**

Two good qualities which may appear to be mutually exclusive prove to be non contradictory for those who have wisdom. 

```
Even bodhisattvas possessed of great kingdoms,
Who have sensory objects similar to divine substances,
Remain uncorrupted in their very nature.
This is the power of having the virtue of wisdom as their minister.

Their love, inseparable from helping others,
Is utterly free of stain from attachment.
Their compassion, unable to bear for others suffering,
Never succumbs to laziness due to the burden of distress.

Possessed of supreme joy, they do not waver from the real.
Their great impartiality never neglects the welfare of beings.
Great wisdom removes all that would counteract
These good qualities, and so it beautifies them.
