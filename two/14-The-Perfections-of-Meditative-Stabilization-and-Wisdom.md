### 1. What Meditative Stabilization is

**Meditative stabilization is a virtuous, one-pointed state of mind that stays fixed on its object of meditation without distraction to other things**

```
It is the one-pointed state of mind-- stabilized on virtue, and either mundane or supramundane -- of bodhisattvas who have first studied and reflected on the bodhisattvas scriptural collections. Whether it is oriented toward meditative serenity, toward insight, or toward both as the path that conjoins them, understand that this one-pointed state of mind is the bodhisattva's meditative stabilization. 

Asanga - Bodhisattva Bhumis

```
Having thus generated joyous perseverance,
Set your mind in meditative concentration

Shantideva
```
