### 1. What Meditative Stabilization is

**Meditative stabilization is a virtuous, one-pointed state of mind that stays fixed on its object of meditation without distraction to other things**

```
It is the one-pointed state of mind-- stabilized on virtue, and either mundane or supramundane -- of bodhisattvas who have first studied and reflected on the bodhisattvas scriptural collections. Whether it is oriented toward meditative serenity, toward insight, or toward both as the path that conjoins them, understand that this one-pointed state of mind is the bodhisattva's meditative stabilization. 

Asanga - Bodhisattva Bhumis
```

```
Having thus generated joyous perseverance,
Set your mind in meditative concentration

Shantideva
```

### 2. How to begin the cultivation of meditative stabilization

Think over the benefits of meditative stabilization and the faults of not cultivating it. I will explain this in the meditative serenity section.

### 3. The divisions of meditative stabilization

In line with the above citation from Asanga, if you subdivide meditative stabilization according to:

according to nature: 
1. mundane
1. supramundane

according to orientation: 
1. serenity
1. insight
1. both conjoined

according to function: 
1. **meditative stabilization that stabilizes mind and body in bliss within this life** - meditative stabilizations that generate mental and physical pliancy when you enter them with equipose
1. **meditative stabilization that achieves good qualities** - meditative stabilizations which accomplish good qualities shared with the shravakas - the superknowledges, liberations, totalities, masteries, etc.
1. **meditative stabilization that carries out the welfare of living beings** - meditative stabilization that accomplishes the eleven activites for others welfare

### 4. How to practice

Whenever you practice any virtuous meditative stabilization you do so in association with the six supremacies and all 6 perfections. The generosity of meditative stabilization is maintaining meditative stabilization yourself and then establishing others in it. Understand the other perfections from earlier explanation.

### 5. A summary

The recollection and the cultivation of the spirit of enlightenment -- the basis of the bodhisattva deeds-- is what inspires you to train in order to set all living beings in uncontaminated meditative stabilization. After you have increased the stability of this spirit, aspire to the high meditative stabilizations and train in these. Even if you are unable to fully develop the stabilizations, you must strive to train from time to time in one-pointed concentration to whatever extent you are able.

**If you do not do so, you will be continually stained with the fault of breaking the precepts, and in other lives as well you will find it most difficult to learn the trainings for entering the many doors of the bodhisattva's meditative stabilization.** 

**Whereas, if you never give up your effort, even in this like your mind will become steadily less distracted, making your accumulations of virtues very powerful. In future lives you will have physical and mental bliss and a joyful mind, thereby easily completing the perfection of meditative stabilization.**

### 1. What wisdom is

In general, wisdom is what thoroughly discerns the ontological status of the object under analysis, but in this context wisdom refers to proficiency in the five topics of knowledge and the like.

```
Know that bodhisattva's wisdom is the thorough analysis of phenomena that engages or has engaged all of what is to be known and that operates through focusing on the five topics of knowledge -- Buddhist knowledge, grammar, logic, technical arts, and medicine. 

Asanga Bodhisattva Levels
```

Here, the wisdom that "engages" refers to wisdom prior to attaining the bodhisattva levels; wisdom that "has engaged" refers to wisdom after attaining such levels.
