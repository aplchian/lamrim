2 Parts:
1. How to not to give
2. How to give

### a. How not to give
Cast aside these 13 ways of giving, because they are to be eliminated.

1. not giving right away, but only after you have delayed
2. giving under stress
3. giving after you have involved yourself in affairs nor with the teachings or the ways of the world.
4. making a commitment before “I will give this much”, and later making a gift of reduce quality or amount
5. giving in return for favors
6. giving in installments when you could give all at one time
7. as a ruler, giving away someones child or spouse that you have kidnapped
8. taking through pressure the belongings of others and then giving them to others
9. making a gift by a method that will hurt someone else
10. while you remain idle, employing someone else to do the giving
11. giving while you have contempt for the one asking for something
12. giving while you violate the buddhas prohibitive precepts
13. not giving resources as you acquire them, but after you accumulate them for a long time.

During the period you are storing up the goods you produce many afflictions such as stinginess and the like, the trouble of safeguarding them and so forth becomes a hindrance to many virtuous actions, and more often than not you lose them at some point and are not able to give them away in the end anyway.

### b. How to give

First of all, smile with a beaming countenance and then give to any recipient, showing respect by speaking honestly. Give with your own hands, at the appropriate time, without hurting anyone else, and bearing the suffering of any hardship

You can help others to plan the seed of generosity by giving them something and telling them to give it away.

If you have no belongings, you may build up wealth through a craft or job, and then give it away

As you sort through the material goods for charity, give the better first and give away completely all good presented for charity.

## 4. Things to Give

2 parts: 
1. Brief presentation of the things which are and are not to be given
2.  Detailed explanation of the things which are and are not to be given

### a. Brief presentation of the things which are and are not to be given
In Brief, bodhisattva’s should give to others those things which immediately produce in the recipients pleasurable feelings that are free from the causes for a miserable rebirth and which ultimately will benefit them, either eliminating their sin, or setting them in virtue.

Even if these things do not immediately bring happiness, they should give them if they are beneficial in the end.

They should not give them things which immediately produce pain and ultimately cause harm, or which are immediately pleasant but ultimately harmful.

### b.  Detailed explanation of the things which are and are not to be given
2 sections:

1. Detailed explanation about inner things which are and are not to be given
2. Detailed explanation about outer things which are and are not to be given

1. Inappropriate giving from the viewpoint of time
2. Inappropriate giving from the viewpoint of purpose
3. Inappropriate giving from the viewpoint of the one who asks for something
