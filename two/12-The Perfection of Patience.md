## How to train in the Perfection of Patience

5 parts:
1. What patience is
2. How to being the cultivation of patience
3. The divisions of patience 
4. How to practice
5. A summary

## 1. What patience is
Patience is:
1. disregarding harm done to you
2. accepting the suffering arising in your mind stream
3. being certain about the teachings and firmly maintaining belief in them

There are 3 sets of factors that incompatible with these:

1. for the first - **hostility**
2. for the second - **hostility and loss of courage**
3. for the third - **disbelief and dislike**

Perfecting patience means that you simply complete your conditioning to a state of mind wherein you have stopped your anger and the like. 

```
`Undisciplined persons are as limitless as space;
You could never overcome them.
If you conquer the single mental state of anger
It is like vanquishing all your enemies.

Where could you get enough leather
To cover the entire surface of the earth?
Wearing just the leather of your sandals
Is like covering all the earth.

Similarly, I cannot change
External thing, but when
I can change my state of mind,
Why do I need to change anything else?

Shantideva
```
`
## 2. How to begin the cultivation of patience

Although there are many ways to cultivate patience, to begin I will explain the meditation on the benefits of patience and the faults of not being patient.

- will not have many enemies later one
- will not have many separations from those to whom they are close
- will have much happiness and contentment
- have not regret at the time of death
- will be reborn among the dieties in the higher realms

by looking at such benefits, they too are patient. They engage others in upholding patience, and they also praise patience. When they see patient persons, they are delighted and full of joy.

```
`Patience is also the craftsmen that creates a buddha’s embodiment of form,
Adorned with the beautiful signs of good qualities.

Compendium of Perfections
```
`
```
`Whoever works hard and overcomes anger
Is happy in this and future lives

Shantideva
```
`
When you rely on patience continually, you do not spoil your joyful attitude, so you are always happy even in this life. Moreover, patience stops miserable rebirth in future lives, give special rebirths in the happy realms, and ultimately bestows certain goodness, so you are utterly happy in this and future lives.

Meditate on these benefits until you gain a strong, firm certainty about the cause and effect relationship wherein benefits such as these arise from patience.

With respect to the faults of anger:

```
`Any good deeds, such as
Generosity and worshipping the sugars,
You have collected over a thousand eons
Are all destroyed in one moment of anger.

Shantideva
```
`
In general, for there to be destruction of the roots of virtue it is not required that the anger be toward bodhisattvas.

How it stops the non virtue is like how the 4 opponent powers stop the ripening of the karma. It’s like spoiling the seeds. 

Thus, the invisible faults of anger are that it projects its on fruitions, which are extremely unpleasant, and that it prevents the arising of the measureless very pleasant fruitions of its opposite — virtue.

The faults of anger visible in this lifetime are that you do not experience a peaceful and good mind; the joy and happiness that you had previously perish, and you cannot regain them; you cannot sleep well; and you weaken the stability wherein your mind stays calm. Even friends and family will get annoyed and leave you.

Meditate until you are firmly convinces that grave consequences such as these arise from anger.

```
`There is no sin like hatred
And no fortitude like patience.
Therefore, earnestly cultivate
Patience in a variety of ways

Shantideva
```
`
**So, first, understand the benefits and faults, and then strive to cultivate patience in many ways. **

## 3. The Divisions of Patience
3 parts:
1. Developing the patience of disregarding harm done to you
2. Developing the patience of accepting suffering
3. Developing the patience of certitude about the teachings


### a. Developing the patience of disregarding harm done to you
has 2 parts:
1. Stopping impatience with those who harm you
2. Stopping both dislike for harm doers attainments and delight in their troubles

#### 1. Stopping impatience with those who harm you

2 parts:
1. Stopping impatience with those who prevent your happiness and with those who cause you to suffer
2. Stopping impatience with those who prevent your praise, fame or honor, and with those who have contempt for you, or say offensive or unpleasant things to you
#### 1. Stopping impatience with those who prevent your happiness and with those who cause you to suffer
 2 parts:

1. showing that anger is unjustified
2. showing that compassion is appropriate


#### 1. showing that anger is unjustified
3 parts:

1. On analysis of the object, anger is unjustified
2. On analysis of the subject, anger is unjustified
3. On analysis of the basis, anger is unjustified

#### 1. On analysis of the object, anger is unjustified

4 parts:

1. On analysis of whether the object has self control, anger is unjustified
2. On analysis for either the adventitiousness or inherency, anger is unjustified
3. On analysis of whether the harm is direct or indirect, anger is unjustified
4. On analysis of the cause that impels the harm doers, anger is unjustified

#### 1. On analysis of whether the object has self control, anger is unjustified
Analyze thinking: “What would be reasonable grounds for anger toward harm doers?” Whereupon, you might think “They first had the though of wanting to harm me, prepared the method, and then either prevented my happiness or inflicted unpleasant physical or mental suffering, so my anger was justified”

Those who inflict harm do not have control over themselves, for, when the conditions and causes — seeds left by afflictions who which they were previously habituated, a nearby object, and erroneous conceptions — come together, they give rise to the thought to harm. If those causes and conditions are not complete, they will never produce the thought to harm. 

**These causes and conditions produce the desire to harm,; this in turn produces the work of harming; and produces suffering for someone else, so those harm doers do not have event the slightest self control. They have become like servants to their afflictions.**

If you are mad because they have no self control, then your anger is totally unjustified. Its like people who are possessed by demons and do harm to their friends. Their friends do not feel hatred towards the person, because they know they are possessed by demons. They then strive to the best of their ability to free them of their demons. 

**Likewise, when bodhisattvas are hurt by others, they think “They do this because the demons of the afflictions have eliminated their ability to control themselves.”** Without being even the slightest bit angry they then must generate the spirit of enlightenment thinking “I will strive at the bodhisattva deeds and eliminate them from these afflictions.”

```
`Just as a doctor does not fight but helps
Patients who are possessed by spirits, they they get angry,
So the Sage sees that the afflictions are at fault,
Not the persons who have the afflictions.

Aryadeva
```
`
```
`This is not the living beings’ fault,
Rather it is the fault of the afflictions.
So the learned analyze 
And do not fight with others.

Chandrakirti
```
`
Although many reasons are set forth in `The Way of the Bodhisattva`, it is easy to be certain of this one, and it is a very powerful remedy against anger. It also talks about how you can bear harm after you meditate on the idea of mere phenomena.  **So meditate repeatedly on this remedy until you reach certain knowledge of it.**

**If these beings had self-control, they would not have any suffering, because they would not want suffering and because they could control it.**

You should stop you anger also by thinking “When these beings are moved by strong afflictions, they commit suicide, leap from cliffs, harm themselves with thorns, weapons, etc. and stop eating and so forth” If they do this to even their great cherished self, of course they will do so to others.

```
`Thus everything is dependent on something else,
And, because that in turn is dependent, it is not autonomous.
Understanding this, do not be angry
At anything, all things are like illusions.

Shantideva
```
`
#### 2. On analysis for either the adventitiousness or inherency, anger is unjustified

The fault of doing harm to others either is or is not in the nature of living beings. If it is in their nature, it is wrong to get angry, just as it is wrong to get angry at fire for being hot and burning. Similarly if it is adventitious it is also wrong to be angry, just like it would be wrong to get angry at the sky for having the flaws of smoke obscuring it. 

```
`If doing harm to others
Is natural for the childish
It is wrong to get angry at them,
Just as it is at fire’s burning nature

Still, if the fault is adventitious,
And the nature of beings is good,
My anger is wrong, just as is
Anger at smoke’s appearance in the sky.

Shantideva
```
`
#### 3. On analysis of whether the harm is direct or indirect, anger is unjustified
If you are angry at the agent of harm that directly inflicts the harm, you will have to be angry at the stick, etc, just as you are at the person. If you are angry at the person, it is the hostility that impels the person, so you should be angry at the hostility. 

```
`The stick and so forth directly cause the harm
But if I am angry at the one who throws it,
Then, since hostility impels them,
It is better to get angry at hostility

Shantideva
```
`
**If you are not angry at the stick, it is also wrong to be angry at the one who throws it; if you are angry at the one who throws it, it is correct to be angry also at the hostility.** Not believing this, your mind has gone down a wrong path.  Become certain of the overall logic here. Further, use the reasoning as before on whether the stick or the person each have harmful intent.

#### 4. On analysis of the cause that impels the harm doers, anger is unjustified
