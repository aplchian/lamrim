# 12. The Perfection of Patience
## How to train in the Perfection of Patience

5 parts:
1. What patience is
2. How to being the cultivation of patience
3. The divisions of patience 
4. How to practice
5. A summary

## 1. What patience is
Patience is:
1. disregarding harm done to you
2. accepting the suffering arising in your mind stream
3. being certain about the teachings and firmly maintaining belief in them

There are 3 sets of factors that incompatible with these:

1. for the first - **hostility**
2. for the second - **hostility and loss of courage**
3. for the third - **disbelief and dislike**

Perfecting patience means that you simply complete your conditioning to a state of mind wherein you have stopped your anger and the like. 

```
`Undisciplined persons are as limitless as space;
You could never overcome them.
If you conquer the single mental state of anger
It is like vanquishing all your enemies.

Where could you get enough leather
To cover the entire surface of the earth?
Wearing just the leather of your sandals
Is like covering all the earth.

Similarly, I cannot change
External thing, but when
I can change my state of mind,
Why do I need to change anything else?

Shantideva
```
`
## 2. How to begin the cultivation of patience

Although there are many ways to cultivate patience, to begin I will explain the meditation on the benefits of patience and the faults of not being patient.

- will not have many enemies later one
- will not have many separations from those to whom they are close
- will have much happiness and contentment
- have not regret at the time of death
- will be reborn among the dieties in the higher realms

by looking at such benefits, they too are patient. They engage others in upholding patience, and they also praise patience. When they see patient persons, they are delighted and full of joy.

```
`Patience is also the craftsmen that creates a buddha’s embodiment of form,
Adorned with the beautiful signs of good qualities.

Compendium of Perfections
```
`
```
`Whoever works hard and overcomes anger
Is happy in this and future lives

Shantideva
```
`
When you rely on patience continually, you do not spoil your joyful attitude, so you are always happy even in this life. Moreover, patience stops miserable rebirth in future lives, give special rebirths in the happy realms, and ultimately bestows certain goodness, so you are utterly happy in this and future lives.

Meditate on these benefits until you gain a strong, firm certainty about the cause and effect relationship wherein benefits such as these arise from patience.

With respect to the faults of anger:

```
`Any good deeds, such as
Generosity and worshipping the sugars,
You have collected over a thousand eons
Are all destroyed in one moment of anger.

Shantideva
```
`
In general, for there to be destruction of the roots of virtue it is not required that the anger be toward bodhisattvas.

How it stops the non virtue is like how the 4 opponent powers stop the ripening of the karma. It’s like spoiling the seeds. 

Thus, the invisible faults of anger are that it projects its on fruitions, which are extremely unpleasant, and that it prevents the arising of the measureless very pleasant fruitions of its opposite — virtue.

The faults of anger visible in this lifetime are that you do not experience a peaceful and good mind; the joy and happiness that you had previously perish, and you cannot regain them; you cannot sleep well; and you weaken the stability wherein your mind stays calm. Even friends and family will get annoyed and leave you.

Meditate until you are firmly convinces that grave consequences such as these arise from anger.

```
`There is no sin like hatred
And no fortitude like patience.
Therefore, earnestly cultivate
Patience in a variety of ways

Shantideva
```
`
**So, first, understand the benefits and faults, and then strive to cultivate patience in many ways. **

## 3. The Divisions of Patience
3 parts:
1. Developing the patience of disregarding harm done to you
2. Developing the patience of accepting suffering
3. Developing the patience of certitude about the teachings


### a. Developing the patience of disregarding harm done to you
has 2 parts:
1. Stopping impatience with those who harm you
2. Stopping both dislike for harm doers attainments and delight in their troubles

#### 1. Stopping impatience with those who harm you

2 parts:
1. Stopping impatience with those who prevent your happiness and with those who cause you to suffer
2. Stopping impatience with those who prevent your praise, fame or honor, and with those who have contempt for you, or say offensive or unpleasant things to you
#### 1. Stopping impatience with those who prevent your happiness and with those who cause you to suffer
 2 parts:

1. showing that anger is unjustified
2. showing that compassion is appropriate


#### 1. showing that anger is unjustified
3 parts:

1. On analysis of the object, anger is unjustified
2. On analysis of the subject, anger is unjustified
3. On analysis of the basis, anger is unjustified

#### 1. On analysis of the object, anger is unjustified

4 parts:

1. On analysis of whether the object has self control, anger is unjustified
2. On analysis for either the adventitiousness or inherency, anger is unjustified
3. On analysis of whether the harm is direct or indirect, anger is unjustified
4. On analysis of the cause that impels the harm doers, anger is unjustified

#### 1. On analysis of whether the object has self control, anger is unjustified
Analyze thinking: “What would be reasonable grounds for anger toward harm doers?” Whereupon, you might think “They first had the though of wanting to harm me, prepared the method, and then either prevented my happiness or inflicted unpleasant physical or mental suffering, so my anger was justified”

Those who inflict harm do not have control over themselves, for, when the conditions and causes — seeds left by afflictions who which they were previously habituated, a nearby object, and erroneous conceptions — come together, they give rise to the thought to harm. If those causes and conditions are not complete, they will never produce the thought to harm. 

**These causes and conditions produce the desire to harm,; this in turn produces the work of harming; and produces suffering for someone else, so those harm doers do not have event the slightest self control. They have become like servants to their afflictions.**

If you are mad because they have no self control, then your anger is totally unjustified. Its like people who are possessed by demons and do harm to their friends. Their friends do not feel hatred towards the person, because they know they are possessed by demons. They then strive to the best of their ability to free them of their demons. 

**Likewise, when bodhisattvas are hurt by others, they think “They do this because the demons of the afflictions have eliminated their ability to control themselves.”** Without being even the slightest bit angry they then must generate the spirit of enlightenment thinking “I will strive at the bodhisattva deeds and eliminate them from these afflictions.”

```
`Just as a doctor does not fight but helps
Patients who are possessed by spirits, they they get angry,
So the Sage sees that the afflictions are at fault,
Not the persons who have the afflictions.

Aryadeva
```
`
```
`This is not the living beings’ fault,
Rather it is the fault of the afflictions.
So the learned analyze 
And do not fight with others.

Chandrakirti
```
`
Although many reasons are set forth in `The Way of the Bodhisattva`, it is easy to be certain of this one, and it is a very powerful remedy against anger. It also talks about how you can bear harm after you meditate on the idea of mere phenomena.  **So meditate repeatedly on this remedy until you reach certain knowledge of it.**

**If these beings had self-control, they would not have any suffering, because they would not want suffering and because they could control it.**

You should stop you anger also by thinking “When these beings are moved by strong afflictions, they commit suicide, leap from cliffs, harm themselves with thorns, weapons, etc. and stop eating and so forth” If they do this to even their great cherished self, of course they will do so to others.

```
`Thus everything is dependent on something else,
And, because that in turn is dependent, it is not autonomous.
Understanding this, do not be angry
At anything, all things are like illusions.

Shantideva
```
`
#### 2. On analysis for either the adventitiousness or inherency, anger is unjustified

The fault of doing harm to others either is or is not in the nature of living beings. If it is in their nature, it is wrong to get angry, just as it is wrong to get angry at fire for being hot and burning. Similarly if it is adventitious it is also wrong to be angry, just like it would be wrong to get angry at the sky for having the flaws of smoke obscuring it. 

```
`If doing harm to others
Is natural for the childish
It is wrong to get angry at them,
Just as it is at fire’s burning nature

Still, if the fault is adventitious,
And the nature of beings is good,
My anger is wrong, just as is
Anger at smoke’s appearance in the sky.

Shantideva
```
`
#### 3. On analysis of whether the harm is direct or indirect, anger is unjustified
If you are angry at the agent of harm that directly inflicts the harm, you will have to be angry at the stick, etc, just as you are at the person. If you are angry at the person, it is the hostility that impels the person, so you should be angry at the hostility. 

```
`The stick and so forth directly cause the harm
But if I am angry at the one who throws it,
Then, since hostility impels them,
It is better to get angry at hostility

Shantideva
```
`
**If you are not angry at the stick, it is also wrong to be angry at the one who throws it; if you are angry at the one who throws it, it is correct to be angry also at the hostility.** Not believing this, your mind has gone down a wrong path.  Become certain of the overall logic here. Further, use the reasoning as before on whether the stick or the person each have harmful intent.

#### 4. On analysis of the cause that impels the harm doers, anger is unjustified
The experience of suffering produced by those who harm does not occur causelessly or from discordant causes, so it occurs from concordant causes, which means it comes from non virtuous actions that you have done in the past. **Therefore, harm doers are helplessly impelled to do harm by the power of your karma.** Consequently, blame yourself thinking “This is my fault, and I am wrong to get angry at others.”, and stop your anger on all occasions.

**It is similar in the way that beings produce the guardians of hell with their own bad karma, and these guardians then inflict harm on them.**

```
`I, at former time, inflicted
Harm such as this on living beings.
Therefore, it is fitting that I, who hurt others,
Show receive this harm.

Shantideva
```
`
```
`When you say “I am not at fault,” it indicates that you, in fact, have not internalized even a bit of the teaching.

Sha-bo-wa
```
`
#### 2. On analysis of the subject, anger is unjustified

If you get angry at a harder through an inability to bear suffering, it is contradictory because, even as you are failing to bear slight suffering, in the present, you are aggressively creating the cause for measureless suffering in the miserable realms.

Therefore, induce a sense of embarrassment thinking “I am very stupid,” and work to contain your anger.

```
`If I cannot endure
Even the slightest suffering of the present,
Then why do I not stop my anger,
The cause of suffering in the hells?

Shantideva
```
`
The suffering generated by harm is the effect off previous bad karma; by experiencing it, you exhaust this karma. If you bear the suffering, you do not accumulate new sins and you greatly increase your merit.

You must not consider how harm doers ruin their virtue, but view them as kind in that they are engaged in actions for the sake of clearing away your sins.

```
`You want to say that you are exhausting 
The effects of non virtuous karma done in the past;
How then can you sow the seeds of further suffering
By getting angry and harming others?

Chandrakirti Commentary on the Middle Way
```
`
**Therefore, just as you tolerate bleeding and burning as a treatment to cure a sever illness, it is appropriate to bear small sufferings for the sake of preventing great suffering**

#### 3. On analysis of the basis, anger is unjustified
 2 parts:
1. Analyzing the causes of harm and where the fault lies
2. Analyzing your commitment

#### a’. Analyzing the causes of harm and where the fault lies

```
`His sword and my body
Are both causes of suffering.
He obtained the sword, I obtained the body;
At which should I be angry?

If, blinded by craving, I have obtained 
The abscess with a human form,
So painful that it cannot bear to be touched,
With whom should I be angry when it is hurt?

Shantideva
```
`
```
`If some people, out of confusion, harm others
While others in confusion get angry with them,
Who is blameless
And who is to blame?

Shantideva
```
`
#### b’. Analyzing your commitment
Develop the fortitude of patience thinking:  “It is wrong for even shravakas who act for their one purposes alone, to be impatient and get angry. So of course it is wrong for me.” I committed myself to achieving the benefit and happiness of all living beings when I generated the spirit of enlightenment. I act for others’ welfare and care for all beings.

#### b. Showing that Compassion is appropriate
Contemplate from the depths of your heart how all beings have been you mother and cared for you. Being impermanent they lose their lives and are miserable to the 3 types of suffering. Crazed by the demons of the afflictions they destroy their own welfare in this and future lives. I must generate compassion for them. How could it be right to be angry or to retaliate for harm?

#### 2’. Stopping impatience with those who prevent your praise, fame or honor, and with those who have contempt for you, or say offensive or unpleasant things to you.

2 Parts:

1. Stopping impatience with those who prevent three things— praise, fame, or honor.
2. Stopping impatience with those who do three things to you — have contempt for you, or say offensive or unpleasant things to you.

#### a. Stopping impatience with those who prevent three things— praise, fame, or honor.
3 parts:
1. Reflection on how praise and so forth lack good qualities
2. Reflection on how praise and so forth have faults
3. The need to delight in those who prevent praise and so forth

#### 1. Reflection on how praise and so forth lack good qualities

When others praise you and speed your fame, it serves neither of 2 purposes:
1. for this life it does not bring you long life, health, and the like, 
2. and for future lives it does not bring merit and so forth

Therefore do not get attached to fame or praise, but reproach yourself and think - **”My displeasure when my fame and praise are ruined is no different from when small children cry upon the collapse of their sand castles, which lack event the requisites for a dwelling.”**

```
`Praise, fame, and honor
Do not cause merit, nor longevity,
Nor cause strength, nor health,
Nor bring physical well-being.

Once I understand my own welfare,
What meaning is there for me in those?

Shantideva
```
`
#### 2. Reflection on how praise and so forth have faults
Develop disgust for praise and so forth, thinking: **”Praise, fame, and honor distract my mind with the meaningless, destroy my disenchantment with cyclic existence, make me jealous of those with good qualities, and spoil my virtuous activites”**

```
`Praise and so forth distract me,
Destroy my disenchantment,
Promote my jealousy of this with good qualities,
And destroy all that is good.
```
`
#### 3. The need to delight in those who prevent praise and so forth

Stop your anger and feel delight from the depths of your heart thinking: “In that case, damage to my fame, praise, gain, and honor protects me from going to the miserable realms, cuts the bonds of my attachment, and, like the buddha’s blessing, blocks the door through which I am about to enter suffering.”

Thinking like this from the depths of your heart you should stop anger and feel happy.

#### 2. Stopping impatience with those who do three things to you — have contempt for you, or say offensive or unpleasant things to you.
