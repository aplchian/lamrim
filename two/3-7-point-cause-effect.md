2. Training the mind to be intent on enlightenment
3. Identifying the spirit of enlightenment, the fruit of the training

## 1. Training the mind to be intent on others' welfare

This has 2 sections:

1. a. Establishing the basis for establishing this attitude
2. The development of the attitude of being intent on others' welfare


## 1 Establishing the basis for establishing this attitude

This has 2 parts:

1. Achieving impartiality toward living beings
2. Having affection for all beings

### (a) Achieving impartiality toward living beings


Practice the preliminary practices as explained in the 2 lower scopes here as well and then sustain your meditation.


From the outset establish an even-minded attitude, eliminating the bias which comes from attachment to some living beings and hostility towards others... otherwise any love or compassion you feel will be biased... you will never feel unbiased love or compassion. 

There are 3 kinds of impartiality:

1. equanimity with respect to application
2. the feeling of impartiality
3. immeasurable impartiality

**In this section, impartiality refers to the last one - immeasurable impartiality**

Immeasurable impartiality has 2 types:

1. wishing that living beings were free from afflictions such as attachment and hostility
2. **being even-minded yourself after you have become free from attachment and hostility toward living beings.**


**In this section impartiality refers to the latter ^**

The steps for cultivating immeasurable impartiality are as follows:

Since you can easily be impartial to a person toward whom you have neutral feelings, first take as an object of your meditation such a person, someone who has neither helped or harmed you. Achieve an even-mindedness towards this person, removing your attachment and hostility.

Once you have attained this cultivate even-mindedness toward a friend. Your lack of evenhandedness toward this friend is either because of the degree of your attachment for this person or because of the bias from your attachment and hostility.

After you have achieve evenhandedness toward this friend, cultivate it toward and enemy. Your lack of even mindedness toward this person is due to your hostility, viewing him or her as totally disagreeable. 

After you are even minded toward this person, finally cultivate it towards all living beings.

Q: So what meditation eliminates attachment and hostility toward these 3 persons?

A: Kamalashila's second stages of meditation offers 2 approaches:

contemplate as follows: 

1. "from living beings" viewpoint, all equally want happiness and do not want suffering. Therefore it is inappropriate to hold some close and help them, while keeping others distant and harming or not helping them.
2. "from my viewpoint, if I have continuously been reborn since beginning less time, all beings have been my friends hundreds of times. To whom should I be attached? To whom should I be hostile?"


```
Formerly I have killed all of you,
And you have slashed and dismembered me.
All of us have been mutual enemies and killed one another.
How could you be attached?

Daughter Like the Finest Moon's Discourse Sutra
```

Also think about how all friends and enemies can quickly change. By thinking in this way, stop both hostility and attachment.

**It is not the notion of friend or enemy that you need to stop, but the bias that comes from attachment and hostility, which are based on the reason that some people are your friends and others are your enemies.**

### (b) Having affection for all beings

```
Moistened by love, your mind becomes friable, fertile soil. When you plant the seed of compassion, it grows easily and bountifully. Therefore, after you infuse your mind with love, cultivate compassion.

Kamalashila - Second Stages of Meditation
```

The love here views living beings with affection, as if they were your dear children. By cultivating impartiality you eliminate the unevenness in attitude that comes from the bias of your attachment and hostility, and your mind becomes like a good field.

Kamalashila says that if your moisten your mind with the water of love which views all living beings with affection, and you then plant the healthy seed of compassion, you will easily generate the great compassion. **Take this to be very important.**


#### (i) Cultivating a recognition that all beings are your mothers.

Because cyclic existence is beginning less, your births are also without beginning. Therefore you have died and been reborn again and again. There is no kind of body which you have not taken, no place you have not been reborn, and there is not person who has not been a relative such as your mother. 

Moreover, all beings have not only previously been your mothers but will also be your mothers in the future and limitless number of times. **Reflect on this and become convinced all beings have been your mothers.** Once you develop this conviction, you will easily remember their kindness and so forth. If you do not develop it you will have no basis for remembering their kindness. 

#### (ii) Cultivating a remembrance of their kindness

Bodowa says that after you have recognized that all living beings are your mothers you will quickly remember their kindness if at first your cultivate a remembrance of your mothers kindness in this life. Do so in accordance with this:

Imagine your mother in front of you. Think the following a few times "Not only has she been my mother at present, but she has been so an incalculable number of times throughout beginning less existence." As your mother she protected you from all harm and provided you with benefit and happiness. Particularly in this lifetime she carried you for a long time in her womb. Then when you were a helpless newborn she held you to the warmth of her flesh and bounced you on the tips of her 10 fingers. She suckled you with her breast, used her mouth to give you soft food, and to remove mucus from your nose, and used her hand to wipe away your excrement. So in various ways she nurtured you tirelessly. 

.. think along the lines and refer to more on pg. 39

In short, contemplate one pointedly how your mother provided help and happiness and cleared away harm and suffering to the best of her knowledge and ability.

By cultivating your mothers kindness, you will not remember it just in words. Once you give rise to such a remembrance, recognize that other friends and relatives are your mothers and cultivate a remembrance of their kindness. Then do the same towards persons which you have neutral feelings. Once you have developed an attitude towards them which is similar to friends, recognize that your enemies are your mothers and cultivate a remembrance of their kindness. Then recognize that all beings in the 10 directions are your mothers, and then gradually and with extreme extensiveness cultivate a remembrance of their kindness. 



#### (iii) Cultivating a wish to repay your mothers kindness.

These beings, your kind mothers (whom you do not recognize due to the process of death and rebirth) are suffering and have no refuge. There is nothing more shameful than to do your best to liberate yourself from cyclic existence while considering these beings as unimportant and abandoning them.

```
While you see that your relatives are engulfed in the ocean of cyclic existence,
And are as if fallen in a pit of fire,
There is nothing more shameful than to work for your own liberation,
Neglecting those whom you do not recognize due to the process of birth and death.

Candragomin - Letter to a Student
```

Therefore reflect:

"If abandoning such kind being is unsuitable even for disreputable persons, how can it be appropriate in my case?", and then assume responsibility to repay their kindness.
