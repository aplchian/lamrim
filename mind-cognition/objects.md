# Objects

## 1

The purpose of this is to help develop wisdom and develop the vocabulary used in other subjects.

Daka - those who travel through the space of non conceptuality

This is one of the first subjects studied in the monasteries

Lo-rig - the title of this type of study

When you know this you can then study the great texts

pramana - tsema - valid cognition

A philosophical subject on what we know and how we can verify what we now is true - epistemology

All phenomena can be lumped into 2 sections:

1. permanent
2. impermanent

permanent and eternal are different

There are things that are temporarily permanent. When they exist they don't change

emptiness is permanent

emptiness of a pen, but when the pen goes out of existence, so does the pens emptiness

- permanent and not eternal - emptiness
- permanent and eternal - emptiness of the mind
- impermanent and not eternal - pen
- impermanent and eternal - consciousness

Rely on:

- teachings not teacher
- meaning not words
- definitive not interpretable
- non conceptual not conceptual

Purbochok was an incarnation of Maitreya

An object is a synonym for a phenomena that is existent

All phenomena are objects

1. existent - an object, object of knowledge that can be known
2. non existent - sky flower, rabbit horn, self

**object** - that which is known by an awareness - known and cognized by an awareness

consciousness that knows them is the subject

**6 kinds of objects**

1. appearing object
2. determined object
3. object of engagement
4. beheld object
5. object of the mode of apprehension
6. referent / observed object

```
Whatever is an established base is necessarily the object of the mode of apprehension of
both a conceptual and a non-conceptual consciousness.
```

Whatever is an existent object is necessarily the engaged object, is known by both a conceptual and non conceptual consciousness.

How can that be? What consciousness knows a little atom in the desert? The omniscient mind.

Whatever exists can be known by both direct perception and by inference.

Everything that exists is not necessarily the appearing object of a direct perception…

If something is the appearing object of a direct perception it has to be impermanent.

So the emptiness of a cup is permanent. Not eternal, but permanent.

Impermanent phenomena are said to be dissolve every moment and is different in every moment, the next moment is a continuum.

So generalities are permanent. How we develop generalities for ex. ‘Wolf’

The means by which we develop it is indirect.. One we have seen wolf, we know what is not wolf..

The opposite of non-wolf, is the way we get at the generality wolf.

The reverse of non-wolf.



**What is a pervasion?**

`Boone is a wolf because he is male?`

There is non `pervasion` because you are a male you are a wolf.

All Wolfs are pervaded by wolf.



- `On a smoky pass` **(subject)**
- `fire exists` **(predicate)**
- `because smoke exists` **(sign)**
- `like a smoky kitchen` **(example)**

sound is impermanent because it is a product, like a pot

This type of syllogism can give rise to an inferential cognition in your mind that knows that fact

A correct inference must have 3 modes.. 3 things present

1. the property of the subject - the subject has to be the sign .. on a smoky path, smoke exists. sound is a product
2. forward pervasion - if its the sign, its necessarily the predicate.. the sign pervaded the predicate .. smoke exists where fire exists
3. reverse pervasion - the opposite of the predicate pervading the opposite of the sign ... where no fire exists, no smoke exists ..

In general if it has the forward pervasion it will have the reverse, so in theory you don't have to prove the reverse.. but it has to have all 3

Dependent arisings are not necessarily impermanent.

The definition of an **awareness** is `lo` is `rig` .. `something that is a knower, it knows`

**consciousness** (shepa) - `that which is clear and knowing` (shel sing rigpa)

lo
rigpa
shepa

Not clear like clear day.. but when looking at nature of the mind the clarity of the mind has different levels of subtly. on one level its unobstructed nature.. it doesn't prevent other thoughts from coming into it.. its nature is non obstructed.. nor is it obstructed by thoughts in it... anger in your mind doesn't obstruct it for ex.



```

aside

**3 kinds of impermanent phenomena:**
1. matter
2. consciousness
3. non-associate compositional factors-- not associate with the mind .. time, person

Consciousness can't come from matter.. not to say matter cannot support conscious.. it does have a relation with consciousness .. the mind moves through the pathways of the mind
```

We can divide consciousnesses up a bunch of different ways..

**prime cognizer vs non prime cognizer**

prime cognizer is `pramana`

the higher schools refer to prime cognizers as valid cognizers

the lower tenets refer to it as a new , prime, fresh.. the basic meaning is something that has realized its object .. incontrovertibly.. something you can't show as incorrect

a consciousness that has eliminated all superimpositions about something..

```
because the definition of something ís being an incontrovertible
consciousness is
a knower which gets at its object of analysis.

```

after analyzing, it gets after its object correctly

What would it mean to realize the perfect human rebirth? .. One has not just read the words, but has analyzed it an has eliminated all misconceptions and has had some experience of the truth of that.. one has an **incontrovertible consciousness because of that**.. that person would not be someone who wastes time

When you use the logical reasoning presented it removes the superimpositions that make it hard to realize this

Its only when you reach the level of inferential cognizer that you can have the first valid / prime incontrovertible cognizer





## 3


 What it means to have a realization. A consciousness that is realizing something that is incontrovertible. A consciousness that is not deceived about its object.

 Many of our sense consciousnesses are incontrovertible. But as far as our mental consciousness.. We know most things through mental images and conceptions.

 In the tibetan tradition it is said that a quarter of your understanding comes from the teacher. A quarter from your own study. And 50% comes from discussion and debate with others.

 A lot of what we know are not realization.. not incontrovertible knowers.

To meditate on the mind (mahamudra) you first must have a clear image of the mind... to meditate on anything first you have to find the object..

The nature of the mind is very subtle so it first requires you to build up a mental image of it over time.. a mental image you are trying to make factually concordant. Then you can focus on that with single pointed concentration. One instant of mind is cognizant of the last instant of mind. In that way you can let go of these other thoughts much more rapidly.

So this is a little about how what we are talking about here is related to practice... being able build a clear image of the mind.


```
In our own system, the definition of a prime cognizer (pramana) is:
a new incontrovertible knower.
```

There are three 2 kinds of pramana .. valid persons and valid cognizer

By the force of the initial cognition it can induce the subsequent consciousness. If you realize an object for a moment it can induce the subsequent cognitions.

The lower schools say that only this first instant has a special quality of being pramana or valid.

Like the engine of a train, it pulls the rest of the cars.. it is the prime cognizer

According to prasangika the subsequent cognitions are valid.



 2 ways to respond
-  The sign is not established
-  There is no pervasion


When the mind is watching the mind, it's really just watching a previous instant of the mind.

7 Divisions of Knowing:

At first if we were to talk about emptiness. First we might have a wrong consciousness. Things exist!

The Vaibashikas say that even the sense powers know their objects. So the sense power would be a prime cognizer of that object.

Sautrantika says noo... it has to be a new, incontrovertible, **knower**.. and the sense faculty is not a knower.. the immediately preceding condition is the knower that gives rise to the next instant that actually knows the object

**2 kinds of prime cognizers**:

1. direct prime cognizer - can be sense or mental
2. inferential prime cognizer - can only be mental

in order to understand what a direct prime cognizer is we have to understand what a direct perceiver is

**direct perceiver** - a knower which is free from conceptuality and non mistaken

non mistaken means non mistaken about the appearing object.

**A conceptual consciousness is always mistaken consciousness because its mistaken with respect to its appearing object because it appears to be the object itself**

4 direct perceivers:

1. sense - that which is produced in dependence on its own uncommon empowering condition and its a knower free from conceptuality and is not mistaken in regard to its appearing object
2. mental
3. yogic
4. self-knowing (rang rig) - in order to try to explain how we know memory. aware of the fact that knowing is going on




# 4

 Prime Cognizer `tsema` - a new incontrovertible knower

## Sense Direct Perceivers
**Sense Direct Perceiver** - That which is produced in dependence on its own uncommon empowering condition. That which is free from conceptuality and non-mistaken.

The uncommon empowering condition is not the eye ball. But it is the subtle matter, like the rods and cones in the back of our retina that allow an interface between our consciousness and allow it to come into contact with the aspect we are seeing.

Sense direct perceivers are the main direct perceivers we have. Most of us don't have the other types of direct perceivers.

It's said that there are 3 kinds of phenomena that we can know:

**manifest phenomena** - we can know directly for the first time without depending on logic.
**hidden phenomena** (guk yur) - subtle impermanence .. even though subtle permanence is appearing to us, we dont apprehend it with our sense consciousnesses. Even our mental consciousness we may have a little conceptual understanding of it. We can eventually recognize these.. subtle impermanence, selflessness of persons, and emptiness. First we have to intellectually understand them. Once that mental image has become true / correct (dun tun), by meditating on that and developing single pointed concentration, that hidden phenomena can be apprehended with direct perception.
**deeply hidden phenomena** (shintu gok yur) - what the results will be of some karmic action you do. The deeply hidden connection between actions and their affects. Also the hidden qualities of the buddhas that only the buddhas minds can know.

**Manifest phenomena** we can for the first time without relying on inference.

**Hidden phenomena** have to rely on inference first of all. A mental image that is created based on true reasoning. Know it validly then directly.

**Deeply hidden phenomena** have to rely on a particular kind of logic. A valid / reliable person. The Buddha is a valid person. Only a buddha can know this type of connection. The way we can know them is via the agency of the buddha explaining them. In order for that kind of logic to work.. to prove that, you have to prove that person is a valid person.

Here direct perceivers are those that know manifest phenomena.

2 ways to divide sense direct perceivers.

sense direct perceiver - 5 senses .. **its uncommon because its exclusive to that particular sense.. ex. the eye does not hear**

When you divide sense direct perceivers there are 3.

**prime cognizer**
**subsequent cognizer**
**inattentive perception (appears but is not ascertained)** - its not a wrong consciousness. Knows the object but is not mistaken. You can't recall it later that you ascertained it.

Prime cognizer which is a sense direct perceiver -

1. the first moment of a sense direct perceiver apprehending a form. Even sounds / tastes are form. The first moment of such perception is called a valid / prime cognizer.
2. the second moment of a sense direct perceiver apprending form
3. inattentive - in order for it to be ascertained you should be able to recall that you saw it. A sense direct perceiver apprehending a form in the continuum of a person whose mind is especially attracted to a pleasant sound

If you put chocolate on a corpse it wont be a perceiver because there is no immediately preceding condition of consciousness.

Mental consciousness has it's own uncommon empowering condition. Does the mind have a physical sense power? The Brain? No. The uncommon empowering condition of the mental consciousness is a previous moment of consciousness. It could be the same or different than the immediately preceding condition.

## Mental Direct Perceivers

1. a consciousness that is an other knower which is free from conceptuality and non-mistaken and
2. that which is generated in dependence on a mental sense power which is its own uncommon empowering condition

What is an `other knower`? it is knowing something other than itself. Self knowing is a quality ascribed by the sautantrika and mind only. Self knowers know consciousness. Even though an object might be present. One part of the consciousness has the ability to know another object.

What appears to an other knower? An apprehended object. Some kind of thing you are knowing about. A self knower.. its aspect is apprehension itself.

## Yogic Direct Perceiver

1. An other knowing exalted wisdom (con) in a continuum of a superior which is free from conceptuality and non-mistaken.
2. That which is generated in dependence on its own uncommon empowering condition

Its uncommon empowering condition is its meditative stabilization (samadhi). Which is the union of calm-abiding and special insight. 

2 divisions:

- prime
- subsequent cognizer

there is no inattentive yogic cognizer

# 5

referent object / observed object (mik yul) - the referent object doesn't always have to be the apprehended object. 

The utility of the referent object comes when we start talking about conception... when the referent object.. and what you are conceiving is contradictory to the referent object.

So sometimes the referent object is what is being perceived, but some times we are messing with it and perceiving something else.

According to sautrantika, every other knowing consciousness has a self-knower as a apart of its entity.. that is aware not of the object, but just of its state

Anything that exists as an object of thought can be called anything... rabbit possessor and moon

other knower (shin rig) 

the self knower verifies the knowing of the outer object

these tenets posit the self knower to show how memory is possible.. but the upper tenets say that the mere other knower itself knowing that other object is capable of inducing certaintly later that you knew / experienced it.

**Yogic Direct Perceiver**

It's a samahdi which is a union of shamata and vipashyana .. 

Shamata is when there is no more agitation in the mind.. when there arent a lot of thoughts in the mind.. the mud can sink and you are left with a lucid pool of water .. calming the mind from the usual discursive thoughts that causes the afflictions to rise and your mind to be polluted... then you can learn to analyze with that calm mind.. the vipashyana is like a skilled fish that can swim that no longer agitates the pond to bring up discursive thoughts or cause turbulince to the mind..

when you have these 2 together there is a union

that is the necessary empowering condition for a yogic direct perceiver .. 

For an omniscient exalted mind , there is no such thing as a subsequent cognizer.. every instant of an omniscient consciousness engages its object by its own power, even the second and third instances... 

If you asked what type of mind would be an omniscient mind it would be a yogic direct perceiver

Every moment of a yogic direct perceiver is able to know the object by its own power..

buddha has no conceptual mind.. buddha has no mental images

 ## Direct Prime Cognizer

  - a new incontrovertible knower that is free of conceptuality

 incontrovertible means it realizes its object - the object it is apprehending actually exists.. so it can't be a mistaken consciousness 

 4 divisions of direct prime cognizers

  1. self knowing
  2. sense
  3. mental
  4. yogic direct prime cognizer

directly realizing means incontrovertible

the course or subtle selflessness of persons is not something which is .. is not the appearing object

the direct perception realizes the impermanent aggregates and indirectly realizes selflessness 

**so it is realizing with a direct perception, but not realizing it directly**

the beginning of the path of preparation begins when they have a union of tranquil abiding and meditative insight meditating on selflessness / emptiness via a mental image 

union of tranquil abiding and meditative insight doesnt have to be a direct perceiver 

prasangikas say that direct perceptions can know permanent phenomena, but sautrantikas say all they know is impermanent phenomena 

prasangika says the subtle selflessness of persons is the emptiness of the person being truly existant.. the gross selflessness of persons is the persons is empty of being self supporting.. something that is able to support itself.. different that true existant

for sauntrantika that emptiness of self supporting / substantially existant is their subtle.. their gross is the emptiness of the person being permanent, partless, and independent .. this is an intellectually born ignorance.. there is no innate form of this

what does this **self supporting / substantially existant** mean? .. in the lower schools there are 2 types of phenomena.. substantially exist and imputadely existant.. there are some objects that substantially exist.. a forest is something imputedly because a forest of comprised of trees.. if you only see some of the trees you dont see the whole forest.. the same with an army.. they say the self is like this, the self is imputed on the 5 aggregates. 

**the lack of a self supporting substantially existant person is the realization of the subtle selflessness of person, and gross selflessness the person is empty of being permanent partlesss and independent being, and subtle impermanence are the 3 kinds of object yogic direct perceivers take as their object.. the realize them via direct perception, but dont realize them all directly. they realize 2 of the indirectly**

## Facsimile of direct perceptions

**A knower which is mistaken with respect to its appearing object**

**tar nang** - appearing like .. something which appears to be direct perceptions but are not

facsimile of a direct perceiver and mistaken consciousness are synonyms

For something to realized introvertibly it doesn't have to be a direct perception.. you can realize it with a direct perception or with inference

You can know an object perfectly. You develop a conception of emptiness and over time 

#6

You can realize something through inferential cognition and direct perception. These can both be valid. The consciousness has to be incontrivertable and fresh/new (sautrantika) ... to be a tsema 

manifest objects we can realize with direct perception, hidden object we can realize with inference.. emptiness doesnt appear to direct perception for the first time until we have realized it via inference

to realize something means to be incontrivertable with respect to it..

1. to remove misconceptions about it, and to able to induce a certainty afterwards (ascertaining consciousness) that you realize that.. 

**What constitutes a realization?**

It has to be a conciousness that has eliminated misconceptions about something. Either through direct perception or inference. It's gotten at the object and it is conscious of that. It can produce a remembering consciousness that you perceived. To realize is different to believe, even if you believe correctly.

**What constitutes a valid cognition (tsema)?**
There are only 2 kinds. Sense direct perceiver and inferential cognizer. They realize their objects and instances of them that are fresh are valid because they have some kind of potency to pull subsequent cognizers along like the engine of a train. 

pg.19

facsimile - something that looks like the original

**a knower which is mistaken with regard to its appearing object**

There is some kind of mistake with what's appearing to it. All conceptual consciousnesses are mistaken with regard to its appearing object.

In one sense the appearance of the mental image, and the appearance of the object are mixed and we cant differentiate one from the other. It seems like the appearance of the mental image is the object, but it is not. This how the higher tenets say all of our sense perceptions are. 

The prasangika's would say that all objects appear to sense consciousnesses as truly existant.

**All conceptions are facimiles to direct perceivers**

There some kinds of non conceptual facimiles... like looking at the twirled sparkler. It looks like there is an 8 in space, but that sense object is mistaken. There isnt an actual firey 8.

All conceptions are mistaken with respect to their appearing objects.  ex. the conception of impermanence appears to actually be impermanence

When facsimiles of direct perceivers are divided, there are seven. This is because there are 6 conceptual and one non conceptual facsimiles of a direct perceiver

1. **mistaken conception** - a thought apprehending sound as permanent
2. **conventional conception**- an inferental cognizer which realized sounds to be impermanent 
3. **inferentional conceptions** - a thought which is a mind apprehending a sign .. a consciousness which is the cause of having an inference.. they arent the inference, but the cause of the conception
4. **conceptions arisen from inference** - thought which arises after an inferential cognizer .. because its still a conceptual mind
5. **memory conceptions** - a thought which today remembers an object of the past .. it might appear to be very clear
6. **wishing conceptions** - a thought which today wishes for an object of the future .. day dreaming 

There are 4 nonconceptual facsimiles which are a sense consciousness

1. **cause of error exists in the basis** - an eye impaired by an obscuring disease
1. **cause of error exists in the abode** - sitting in a boat which sees the trees as moving when the boat is moving ... so when you are moving
1. **cause of error exists in the object** - quickly whirling firebrand to a sense consciousness that sees a wheel of fire
1. **cause of error exists in the immediately preceding condition** - a disturbed by hatred that sees the earth as red



generally characterized phenomena are permanent
specifically characterized phenomena are impermanent

## Inferential Prime Cognizer

- a new incontrovertible determinative knower that is directly produced in dependence on a correct sign which is its basis

**determinative knower (zhen rig)** - synonym of conceptual mind .. determines/weighing its object..doesnt know it directly .. its imagining, knowing it via imagination .. thinks 'this is that'

**correct signs** - correct reasoning .. could mean the whole sylogism

an inferential cognizer has to be incontrivertable

When inferential cognizers are divided there are 3: 

1. **inferential cognizer by the power of the fact** - inferential cognizer that realizes that sound is impermanent through sign of being a product. All phenomena are empty because they are dependent arisings
2. **through renown** - an inferential cognizer which realizes that it is suitable to to express the rabbit-possessor by the term moon from the **sign of its existing among objects of thought**.. anything that exists among objects of thought can be called anything.. there are no names that exist inherently in objects. This is necessarily an inferential cognizer by the power of the fact, so its a particular variation of the first. 
3. **through belief** - inferential cognizer which realizes that the scripture, "From giving, resources, from ethics, a happy migration," is incontrovertible with respect to the meaning indicated by it by the sign of it being a scripture free from the three contradictions.. you cant logically by the 2 previous types know that giving will create wealth... this is a deeply hidden phenomena .. **belief in a valid person who predicated that.. you have to verify that that person is valid.. then verify the scriptures.. interpretable vs. definitive** .. you cant know deeply hidden phenomena by the power of the fact 

**Terminologically divided** means it sounds like its a division, but its not actually a division

When inferential cognizers are terminonologically divided there are two:

1. **inference for oneself** - an inferential cognizer
1. **inference for another** - correct proof statement .. this is not an inferential cognizer. It's not an actual inferential cognizer, but it can induce a inference. Proof statements are what are given to others. If someone is holding a wrong view.. first you give them an absurd consequence of their belief. Then propose **proof statements** to them that establish in their mind the establishing cognitions (the mind apprending a sign)

This division is terminological, because whatever is an inference must be a consciousness, and inference for another, a proof statement, is sound - matter - and not consciousness. **Thus whatever is an actual inference is necessarily an inference for oneself.**



all depend on correct reasoning

a sign in a sylogism is a logical mark 

# 8

- manifest phenomena initially ascertained by sense direct perceiver
- hidden phenomena initially ascertained by inferential phenomena depending on ordinary sign
- deeply hidden phenomena can be inferred by power of belief in valid person

uncommon empowering condition for mental consciousness is a previous moment of consciousnes.. can be sense consciousnes, mental consciousness

**what are the conditions necessary for consciousness to arise?**

3 conditions:

- object condition (referent) 
- empowering condition 
- immediately preceding condition

**What are the 3 divisions of sense direct perceivers?**

- prime
- subsequent
- inattentive (object appears but is not ascertained)

**what are the possible apprehended objects of yogic direct perceivers?**

Only objects that are conducive towards liberation such as subtle impermanence, gross and subtle selflessness of persons, 4 noble truths, etc.

**What is the referent object of a conception grasping toward self of persons according to prasangika?**

grasping toward self of person means not just apprehending a self of persons, but ascending to it, believing it

the conceived object is an inherently existant person

the referent object is not the object being determined / conceived, its that object which you are referring to

there is an ignorance in our consciousness that refers to mark, a conventionally existant mark, and conceiving of that conventionally existing person as inherently existant

so the answer is the conventially existant person

**What is its conceived object?**
