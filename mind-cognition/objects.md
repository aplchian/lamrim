# Objects

```
Whatever is an established base is necessarily the object of the mode of apprehension of 
both a conceptual and a non-conceptual consciousness.
```

Whatever is an existent object is necessarily the engaged object, is known by both a conceptual and non conceptual consciousness. 

How can that be? What consciousness knows a little atom in the desert? The omniscient mind. 

Whatever exists can be known by both direct perception and by inference.

Everything that exists is not necessarily the appearing object of a direct perception… 

If something is the appearing object of a direct perception it has to be impermanent. 

So the emptiness of a cup is permanent. Not eternal, but permanent.

Impermanent phenomena are said to be dissolve every moment and is different in every moment, the next moment is a continuum.

So generalities are permanent. How we develop generalities for ex. ‘Wolf’

The means by which we develop it is indirect.. One we have seen wolf, we know what is not wolf.. 

The opposite of non-wolf, is the way we get at the generality wolf. 

The reverse of non-wolf. 



**What is a pervasion?**

`Boone is a wolf because he is male?`

There is non `pervasion` because you are a male you are a wolf.

All Wolfs are pervaded by wolf.



`On a smoky pass`(subject) `fire exists`(predicate) `because smoke exists`(sign) `like a smoky kitchen`(example)

sound is impermanent because it is a product, like a pot

This type of syllogism can give rise to an inferential cognition in your mind that knows that fact

A correct inference must have 3 modes.. 3 things present

1. the property of the subject - the subject has to be the sign .. on a smoky path, smoke exists. sound is a product
2. forward pervasion - if its the sign, its necessarily the predicate.. the sign pervaded the predicate .. smoke exists where fire exists
3. reverse pervasion - the opposite of the predicate pervading the opposite of the sign ... where no fire exists, no smoke exists ..

In general if it has the forward pervasion it will have the reverse, so in theory you don't have to prove the reverse.. but it has to have all 3

Dependent arisings are not necessarily impermanent. 

The definition of an **awareness** is `lo` is `rig` .. `something that is a knower, it knows` 

**consciousness** (shepa) - `that which is clear and knowing` (shel sing rigpa)

lo
rigpa
shepa

Not clear like clear day.. but when looking at nature of the mind the clarity of the mind has different levels of subtly. on one level its unobstructed nature.. it doesn't prevent other thoughts from coming into it.. its nature is non obstructed.. nor is it obstructed by thoughts in it... anger in your mind doesn't obstruct it for ex. 



```

aside

**3 kinds of impermanent phenomena:**
1. matter
2. consciousness
3. non-associate compositional factors-- not associate with the mind .. time, person

Consciousness can't come from matter.. not to say matter cannot support conscious.. it does have a relation with consciousness .. the mind moves through the pathways of the mind
```

We can divide consciousnesses up a bunch of different ways.. 

**prime cognizer vs non prime cognizer**

prime cognizer is `pramana`

the higher schools refer to prime cognizers as valid cognizers

the lower tenets refer to it as a new , prime, fresh.. the basic meaning is something that has realized its object .. incontrovertibly.. something you can't show as incorrect

a consciousness that has eliminated all superimpositions about something..

```
because the definition of something ís being an incontrovertible 
consciousness is  
a knower which gets at its object of analysis.î

```		

after analyzing, it gets after its object correctly

What would it mean to realize the perfect human rebirth? .. One has not just read the words, but has analyzed it an has eliminated all misconceptions and has had some experience of the truth of that.. one has an incontrovertible consciousness because of that.. that person would not be someone who wastes time

When you use the logical reasoning presented removes the superimpositions that make it hard to realize this

Its only when you reach the level of inferential cognizer that you can have the first valid / prime incontrovertible cognizer
