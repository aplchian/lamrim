# Objects

## 1

The purpose of this is to help develop wisdom and develop the vocabulary used in other subjects.

Daka - those who travel through the space of non conceptuality

This is one of the first subjects studied in the monasteries

Lo-rig - the title of this type of study

When you know this you can then study the great texts

pramana - tsema - valid cognition

A philosophical subject on what we know and how we can verify what we now is true - epistemology

All phenomena can be lumped into 2 sections:

1. permanent
2. impermanent

permanent and eternal are different

There are things that are temporarily permanent. When they exist they don't change

emptiness is permanent

emptiness of a pen, but when the pen goes out of existence, so does the pens emptiness

- permanent and not eternal - emptiness
- permanent and eternal - emptiness of the mind
- impermanent and not eternal - pen
- impermanent and eternal - consciousness

Rely on:

- teachings not teacher
- meaning not words
- definitive not interpretable
- non conceptual not conceptual

Purbochok was an incarnation of Maitreya

An object is a synonym for a phenomena that is existent

All phenomena are objects

1. existent - an object, object of knowledge that can be known
2. non existent - sky flower, rabbit horn, self

**object** - that which is known by an awareness - known and cognized by an awareness

consciousness that knows them is the subject

**6 kinds of objects**

1. appearing object
2. determined object
3. object of engagement
4. beheld object
5. object of the mode of apprehension
6. referent / observed object

```
Whatever is an established base is necessarily the object of the mode of apprehension of
both a conceptual and a non-conceptual consciousness.
```

Whatever is an existent object is necessarily the engaged object, is known by both a conceptual and non conceptual consciousness.

How can that be? What consciousness knows a little atom in the desert? The omniscient mind.

Whatever exists can be known by both direct perception and by inference.

Everything that exists is not necessarily the appearing object of a direct perception…

If something is the appearing object of a direct perception it has to be impermanent.

So the emptiness of a cup is permanent. Not eternal, but permanent.

Impermanent phenomena are said to be dissolve every moment and is different in every moment, the next moment is a continuum.

So generalities are permanent. How we develop generalities for ex. ‘Wolf’

The means by which we develop it is indirect.. One we have seen wolf, we know what is not wolf..

The opposite of non-wolf, is the way we get at the generality wolf.

The reverse of non-wolf.



**What is a pervasion?**

`Boone is a wolf because he is male?`

There is non `pervasion` because you are a male you are a wolf.

All Wolfs are pervaded by wolf.



- `On a smoky pass` **(subject)**
- `fire exists` **(predicate)**
- `because smoke exists` **(sign)**
- `like a smoky kitchen` **(example)**

sound is impermanent because it is a product, like a pot

This type of syllogism can give rise to an inferential cognition in your mind that knows that fact

A correct inference must have 3 modes.. 3 things present

1. the property of the subject - the subject has to be the sign .. on a smoky path, smoke exists. sound is a product
2. forward pervasion - if its the sign, its necessarily the predicate.. the sign pervaded the predicate .. smoke exists where fire exists
3. reverse pervasion - the opposite of the predicate pervading the opposite of the sign ... where no fire exists, no smoke exists ..

In general if it has the forward pervasion it will have the reverse, so in theory you don't have to prove the reverse.. but it has to have all 3

Dependent arisings are not necessarily impermanent.

The definition of an **awareness** is `lo` is `rig` .. `something that is a knower, it knows`

**consciousness** (shepa) - `that which is clear and knowing` (shel sing rigpa)

lo
rigpa
shepa

Not clear like clear day.. but when looking at nature of the mind the clarity of the mind has different levels of subtly. on one level its unobstructed nature.. it doesn't prevent other thoughts from coming into it.. its nature is non obstructed.. nor is it obstructed by thoughts in it... anger in your mind doesn't obstruct it for ex.



```

aside

**3 kinds of impermanent phenomena:**
1. matter
2. consciousness
3. non-associate compositional factors-- not associate with the mind .. time, person

Consciousness can't come from matter.. not to say matter cannot support conscious.. it does have a relation with consciousness .. the mind moves through the pathways of the mind
```

We can divide consciousnesses up a bunch of different ways..

**prime cognizer vs non prime cognizer**

prime cognizer is `pramana`

the higher schools refer to prime cognizers as valid cognizers

the lower tenets refer to it as a new , prime, fresh.. the basic meaning is something that has realized its object .. incontrovertibly.. something you can't show as incorrect

a consciousness that has eliminated all superimpositions about something..

```
because the definition of something ís being an incontrovertible
consciousness is
a knower which gets at its object of analysis.î

```

after analyzing, it gets after its object correctly

What would it mean to realize the perfect human rebirth? .. One has not just read the words, but has analyzed it an has eliminated all misconceptions and has had some experience of the truth of that.. one has an incontrovertible consciousness because of that.. that person would not be someone who wastes time

When you use the logical reasoning presented removes the superimpositions that make it hard to realize this

Its only when you reach the level of inferential cognizer that you can have the first valid / prime incontrovertible cognizer





## 3


 What it means to have a realization. A consciousness that is realizing something that is incontrovertible. A consciousness that is not deceived about its object.

 Many of our sense consciousnesses are incontrovertible. But as far as our mental consciousness.. We know most things through mental images and conceptions.

 In the tibetan tradition it is said that a quarter of your understanding comes from the teacher. A quarter from your own study. And 50% comes from discussion and debate with others.

 A lot of what we know are not realization.. not incontrovertible knowers.

To meditate on the mind (mahamudra) you first must have a clear image of the mind... to meditate on anything first you have to find the object..

The nature of the mind is very subtle so it first requires you to build up a mental image of it over time.. a mental image you are trying to make factually concordant. Then you can focus on that with single pointed concentration. One instant of mind is cognizant of the last instant of mind. In that way you can let go of these other thoughts much more rapidly.

So this is a little about how what we are talking about here is related to practice... being able build a clear image of the mind.


```
In our own system, the definition of a prime cognizer (pramana) is:
a new incontrovertible knower.
```

There are three 2 kinds of pramana .. valid persons and valid cognizer

By the force of the initial cognition it can induce the subsequent consciousness. If you realize an object for a moment it can induce the subsequent cognitions.

The lower schools say that only this first instant has a special quality of being pramana or valid.

Like the engine of a train, it pulls the rest of the cars.. it is the prime cognizer

According to prasangika the subsequent cognitions are valid.



 2 ways to respond
-  The sign is not established
-  There is no pervasion


When the mind is watching the mind, it's really just watching a previous instant of the mind.

7 Divisions of Knowing:

At first if we were to talk about emptiness. First we might have a wrong consciousness. Things exist!

The Vaibashikas say that even the sense powers know their objects. So the sense power would be a prime cognizer of that object.

Sautrantika says noo... it has to be a new, incontrovertible, **knower**.. and the sense faculty is not a knower.. the immediately preceding condition is the knower that gives rise to the next instant that actually knows the object

**2 kinds of prime cognizers**:

1. direct prime cognizer - can be sense or mental
2. inferential prime cognizer - can only be mental

in order to understand what a direct prime cognizer is we have to understand what a direct perceiver is

**direct perceiver** - a knower which is free from conceptuality and non mistaken

non mistaken means non mistaken about the appearing object.

A conceptual consciousness is always mistaken consciousness because its mistaken with respect to its appearing object because it appears to be the object itself

4 direct perceivers:

1. sense - that which is produced in dependence on its own uncommon empowering condition and its a knower free from conceptuality and is not mistaken in regard to its appearing object
2. mental
3. yogic
4. self-knowing (rang rig) - in order to try to explain how we know memory. aware of the fact that knowing is going on

 Prime Cognizer `tsema` - a new incontrovertible knower

## Sense Direct Perceivers
**Sense Direct Perceiver** - That which is produced in dependence on its own uncommon empowering condition. That which is free from conceptuality and non-mistaken.

The uncommon empowering condition is not the eye ball. But it is the subtle matter, like the rods and cones in the back of our retina that allow an interface between our consciousness and allow it to come into contact with the aspect we are seeing.

Sense direct perceivers are the main direct perceivers we have. Most of us don't have the other types of direct perceivers.

It's said that there are 3 kinds of phenomena that we can know:

**manifest phenomena** - we can know directly for the first time without depending on logic.
**hidden phenomena** (guk yur) - subtle impermanence .. even though subtle permanence is appearing to us, we dont apprehend it with our sense consciousnesses. Even our mental consciousness we may have a little conceptual understanding of it. We can eventually recognize these.. subtle impermanence, selflessness of persons, and emptiness. First we have to intellectually understand them. Once that mental image has become true / correct (dun tun), by meditating on that and developing single pointed concentration, that hidden phenomena can be apprehended with direct perception.
**deeply hidden phenomena** (shintu gok yur) - what the results will be of some karmic action you do. The deeply hidden connection between actions and their affects. Also the hidden qualities of the buddhas that only the buddhas minds can know.

**Manifest phenomena** we can for the first time without relying on inference.

**Hidden phenomena** have to rely on inference first of all. A mental image that is created based on true reasoning. Know it validly then directly.

**Deeply hidden phenomena** have to rely on a particular kind of logic. A valid / reliable person. The Buddha is a valid person. Only a buddha can know this type of connection. The way we can know them is via the agency of the buddha explaining them. In order for that kind of logic to work.. to prove that, you have to prove that person is a valid person.

Here direct perceivers are those that know manifest phenomena.

2 ways to divide sense direct perceivers.

sense direct perceiver - 5 senses .. **its uncommon because its exclusive to that particular sense.. ex. the eye does not hear**

When you divide sense direct perceivers there are 3.

**prime cognizer**
**subsequent cognizer**
**inattentive perception (appears but is not ascertained)** - its not a wrong consciousness. Knows the object but is not mistaken. You can't recall it later that you ascertained it.

Prime cognizer which is a sense direct perceiver -

1. the first moment of a sense direct perceiver apprehending a form. Even sounds / tastes are form. The first moment of such perception is called a valid / prime cognizer.
2. the second moment of a sense direct perceiver apprending form
3. inattentive - in order for it to be ascertained you should be able to recall that you saw it. A sense direct perceiver apprehending a form in the continuum of a person whose mind is especially attracted to a pleasant sound

If you put chocolate on a corpse it wont be a perceiver because there is no immediately preceding condition of consciousness.

Mental consciousness has it's own uncommon empowering condition. Does the mind have a physical sense power? The Brain? No. The uncommon empowering condition of the mental consciousness is a previous moment of consciousness. It could be the same or different than the immediately preceding condition.

## Mental Direct Perceivers

1. a consciousness that is an other knower which is free from conceptuality and non-mistaken and
2. that which is generated in dependence on a mental sense power which is its own uncommon empowering condition

What is an `other knower`? it is knowing something other than itself. Self knowing is a quality ascribed by the sautantrika and mind only. Self knowers know consciousness. Even though an object might be present. One part of the consciousness has the ability to know another object.

What appears to an other knower? An apprehended object. Some kind of thing you are knowing about. A self knower.. its aspect is apprehension itself.

## Yogic Direct Perceiver

1. An other knowing exalted wisdom (con) in a continuum of a superior which is free from conceptuality and non-mistaken.
2. That which is generated in dependence on its own uncommon empowering condition

Its uncommon empowering condition is its meditative stabilization (samadhi). Which is the union of calm-abiding and special insight. 

2 divisions:

- prime
- subsequent congnizer

there is no inattentive yogic cognizer
