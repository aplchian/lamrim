#Madhyamaka

Prasangika's do say external objects exist, but simply because they are perceived by a conventional valid cognition that is not investigating their ultimate nature.

Without any investigation, we normal people see books and chairs, and to us they exist. Therefore, they say on a conventional level, they exist.


### Real and Unreal Conventional Truths

There is a difference here in the Svatantrika and Prasangika.

**Svantrantika says there are 2 categories of conventional truths:**
1. real - tables, chairs, etc -- worldy beings take them as true because that is how they appear to their consciousness
2. unreal - things for which disparity exists between how they are and how they appear -- reflection of a face in a mirror, echo, magicians illusion, etc.

**Prasangikas make no such division -- for them all conventionalites are unreal.** For them, the face and the face in the reflection of the mirror are both deceptive because they appear to be inherently existant. 

They do accept there is a difference between the face and the reflection from the mundane view, though.

For Prasangikas, to apprehend something as a truth is to apprehend it as it actually exists.  **There must be full accordance between its mode of existance and it mode of appearance**

So, the Sva's say that on a worldly conventional level there is no mistake when a consciousness perceives an object as existing inherently. For the Pras there is no difference between truly existing and inherently existing... and both must be refuted.

## Ultimate Truth in Madhyamaka

### Emptiness

Both subschools asser that ultimate truth is the final mode of existance of things and events.

For the Svatantrikas that means the absense of true existance -- there emptiness.

Like the, the assert 2 types of emptiness -- of person, and of phenomenon. But unlike the Pras they do not assert that emptiness of phenomena is sunonumous with the complete cessation of suffering, the 3rd noble truth. For Pras, emptiness and cessation are the same thing. 

The Svatrantika texts usually use the term selflessness, and for them the path that leads to enlightenment is through an understanding of these 2 selflessnesses, of person and phenomena. The selfelessness of phenomena for them is the absence of true existance of phenomena, whereas the selflessness of person refers to the unfindability of a self among the 5 aggregates.. the same selflessnes that is found in the lower schools

The Sva's the pratyekabuddhas and sravakas must realize only the emptiness of true existance to achieve liberation, whereas for the Prasangikas these arhats must have a direct realization of emptiness.. which means not just realizing the absense of true existance ( the absense of causeless, concrete object within the inherent base and label ), but of *inherent* existance aswell -- the fact that there is no inherent nature within even the base and label.

Without the realzing the emptiness of both persons and phenomena there is no way to acheive liberation, and of course, enlightenment.

### The meaning of Paramarta Satya (ultimate truth)

While both schools agree that ultimate truth is the final mode of existance of things and events, they differ when it comes to actually explaining the term *ultimate truth*

In sanskrit, the term for ultimate truth is Paramarta Satya. In tibetan it is *dondam denpa*

For the Svatantrika's the ultimate is broken into 2 levels:
1. The objective, the supreme facts of the mode of existance (don)
2. The subjective, the mind apprehending it (dam)

The final mode of existance of the object, and the supreme mind apprehending the final mode of existance.

*Denpa* means truth in that there is no deception.

But when Prasangika's explain the term dondam they do not split it into these 2 of subject and object. Here .. 'dodam' is the *Supreme Fact* - the final mode of existance of an object is its lack of true and inherent existance. The Prasangika's therfore interpret truth from the objective side, not the subjective.

```

Since it is a fact[don] and it is supreme[dam pa] as well, it is ultimate [don dam]. And since it is true, it is the ultimate truth.

-Chandrakirti
```

Lama Tsongkhapa says that Chandrakirti does not maintain as do others that the uncontaminated wisdome of meditative equipose is the supreme and that the ultimate is its object. He instead maintains that 'ultimate truth' indicates both that it is a fact and that it is supreme. The respect in which ultimate truth is truth is that it is non deceptive.
