#Tenets

Base - how a particular school perceives the manner of existence of phenomena
Path - What should be adopted and what abandoned based on a thorough knowledge of the base
Result - Goal that a practioner attains through following the path

This is the standard template used in the monastaries to explain each school.


#Vaibhashika

Also called the *Great Exposition School* 

###Divisions of Phenomena
This school is the least sophisticated, but their approach to the classification of phenomena has carried over to the other schools.

Before taking an extensive investigation into *how* things exist, it is very useful to be clear *what* exists in the universe.

The overall structure and concepts used in vaibhashika classification apply to the other schools.

#### Componded and Uncomponded phenomena

existant things are presented in 2 categories:

1. compounded 
 - synonym for impermanent phenomena and refers to those things that come into being from causes and conditions
 - form - refers also sounds and smells + color, shape, etc
 - consciousness - all mental events - 6 main consciousness'
 - nonassociated compositional factors - all other phenomena that come together due to causes and conditions but dont fit into the other 2 categories. A classic example is an image we see in a dream. Allthough the dream itself is consciousness the image that appears is not, nor is it form. -- also abstract phenomena such as time, aging, birth, and the very important phenomena of a person. The "I" is neither form nor consciousness, but it comes into existance due to causes and conditions.
2. uncompounded
 - something that is not created by the coming together of causes and conditions
 - something that does not change moment by moment during its existance
 - something that cannot perform a functions

**The main examples of uncompounded phenomena are space and the 2 types of cessations:**

 - **Non-analytical cessation** - temporary ceasing of certain types of negativities, misperceptions, and so on when we enter the medatative concentration that interupts our attachment to sensory objects
 - **Analytical cessation** - occurs by means of the meditation analyzing the reality of things and events and is complete cessation in that there is no reversal. It is the full cessation 

*Space* is the mere absence of obstruction; as such it is not the result of any causes and conditions


### Two truths

Unlike the mahayana schools, there is no real comparable presentation of the 2 truths in this school or the next, even though the terms conventional and ultimate are often used in connection with other things.

The main focus of this schools presentation is on the 37 aspects of the path to enlightenment. These 37 are divided into 7 groups.

These 37 are the main focus for both the vaibasheka and sautantrika.

**A mundane contaminated consciousness -- one that has not realized emptiness or selflessness -- knows conventional truths, whereas supermundane or uncontaminated consciousness - one that has realized selflessness directly - knows ultimate truth** 

##Conventional Truth, and Imputed Existance

**This verse from Vasubandhu explains their view of conventional and ultimate truth most clearly:**

```
If the awareness of something does not operate after that thing
Is destroyed or mentally separated into other things,
Then that thing exists conventionally, like a pot or water.
Others exist ultimately.
```
 
When an object is destroyed or mentally separated into parts, the mind can no longer hold onto that object; therefore it is a conventional truth.

For example a glass jar that falls and breaks. After it breaks the mind can't hold onto it anymore.

For mental events, the object cant be destroyed, but it can be separated into parts.. an hour can be separated into minutes... time can be mentally 'separated'

**Objects that have this quality are called conventional truths**

These are examples of **imputedlty existant objects**

**imputedlty existant objects and conventional truth are synonyms**

Conversely if the object is not a collection of parts, but is the actual substance that makes up those parts, then it is a **substantially existant object**

imputedlty existant => conventional truth
substantially existant => ultimate truth

^^ these terms have different meanings in the other school so dont confuse them!

This category of conventional truth fits with the 3 types of compounded phenomena from earlier. That which can be destroyed is form, that which can be mentally separated is consciousness and nonassociated compounded phenomena.


##Ultimate Truth, and Substantial Existance

```
Other than those are the ultimate truths, because even if the mind is separated from the object, such as when the object is destroyed, the mind apprehending it still operates, for ex. the mind apprehending form.
```

Other here refers to anything that cannot be destroyed or mentally separated into other things. This is ultimate truth according to this school. Which is synonymous with substantial existance.

What can't be broken down?

3 Categories:

1. aggregates
2. uncompounded phenomena
3. substantial particles (of matter or mind)

For this school, although the collections that make up an object can be separated more and more, the aggregate itself (form, feeling, etc) cannot. They differentiate between something having form and form itself. 

For ex. if you have a body that has form and you break it down into smaller particles, it is still form. **The mind apprehending form is never destroyed.**

Ex. A glass jar as glass jar is a conventional truth, but as a form its a ultimate truth. If it breaks, the 'jar' is gone, but the 'form' is still there.

Happiness is conventional, but feeling is ultimate

For this school, ultimate and conventional truth can coexist within one object.

The body as a conventional truth, and the body as form as an ultimate truth.

For this school, uncompounded phenomena are an ultimate truth.. space, cessation.

**Substantial Objects** are ultimate truths. These are the fundamental building blocks of the universe called **partless particles, or in the case of mental events, partless moments of consciousness.**  They are ultimate because they cannot be destroyed or further reduced... and the mind that apprehends these partless particles will never be stopped. They are substantially existant because their existance is not dependent on other substances.

## Ultimate Truth, Selflessness, and Emptiness

pg. 47

#Madhyamaka

Prasangika's do say external objects exist, but simply because they are perceived by a conventional valid cognition that is not investigating their ultimate nature.

Without any investigation, we normal people see books and chairs, and to us they exist. Therefore, they say on a conventional level, they exist.


### Real and Unreal Conventional Truths

There is a difference here in the Svatantrika and Prasangika.

**Svantrantika says there are 2 categories of conventional truths:**
1. real - tables, chairs, etc -- worldy beings take them as true because that is how they appear to their consciousness
2. unreal - things for which disparity exists between how they are and how they appear -- reflection of a face in a mirror, echo, magicians illusion, etc.

**Prasangikas make no such division -- for them all conventionalites are unreal.** For them, the face and the face in the reflection of the mirror are both deceptive because they appear to be inherently existant. 

They do accept there is a difference between the face and the reflection from the mundane view, though.

For Prasangikas, to apprehend something as a truth is to apprehend it as it actually exists.  **There must be full accordance between its mode of existance and it mode of appearance**

So, the Sva's say that on a worldly conventional level there is no mistake when a consciousness perceives an object as existing inherently. For the Pras there is no difference between truly existing and inherently existing... and both must be refuted.

## Ultimate Truth in Madhyamaka

### Emptiness

Both subschools asser that ultimate truth is the final mode of existance of things and events.

For the Svatantrikas that means the absense of true existance -- there emptiness.

Like the, the assert 2 types of emptiness -- of person, and of phenomenon. But unlike the Pras they do not assert that emptiness of phenomena is sunonumous with the complete cessation of suffering, the 3rd noble truth. For Pras, emptiness and cessation are the same thing. 

The Svatrantika texts usually use the term selflessness, and for them the path that leads to enlightenment is through an understanding of these 2 selflessnesses, of person and phenomena. The selfelessness of phenomena for them is the absence of true existance of phenomena, whereas the selflessness of person refers to the unfindability of a self among the 5 aggregates.. the same selflessnes that is found in the lower schools

The Sva's the pratyekabuddhas and sravakas must realize only the emptiness of true existance to achieve liberation, whereas for the Prasangikas these arhats must have a direct realization of emptiness.. which means not just realizing the absense of true existance ( the absense of causeless, concrete object within the inherent base and label ), but of *inherent* existance aswell -- the fact that there is no inherent nature within even the base and label.

Without the realzing the emptiness of both persons and phenomena there is no way to acheive liberation, and of course, enlightenment.

### The meaning of Paramarta Satya (ultimate truth)

While both schools agree that ultimate truth is the final mode of existance of things and events, they differ when it comes to actually explaining the term *ultimate truth*

In sanskrit, the term for ultimate truth is Paramarta Satya. In tibetan it is *dondam denpa*

For the Svatantrika's the ultimate is broken into 2 levels:
1. The objective, the supreme facts of the mode of existance (don)
2. The subjective, the mind apprehending it (dam)

The final mode of existance of the object, and the supreme mind apprehending the final mode of existance.

*Denpa* means truth in that there is no deception.

But when Prasangika's explain the term dondam they do not split it into these 2 of subject and object. Here .. 'dodam' is the *Supreme Fact* - the final mode of existance of an object is its lack of true and inherent existance. The Prasangika's therfore interpret truth from the objective side, not the subjective.

```

Since it is a fact[don] and it is supreme[dam pa] as well, it is ultimate [don dam]. And since it is true, it is the ultimate truth.

-Chandrakirti
```

Lama Tsongkhapa says that Chandrakirti does not maintain as do others that the uncontaminated wisdome of meditative equipose is the supreme and that the ultimate is its object. He instead maintains that 'ultimate truth' indicates both that it is a fact and that it is supreme. The respect in which ultimate truth is truth is that it is non deceptive.

### Ultimate Mind

What distinguishes ultimate from conventional truth is not the object, but it is the way the object is ascertained by the mind.

Analyzed by a conventional mind, the object is a conventional truth; analyzed my an ultimate mind, which sees the lack of inherent existanceof the object, it is in an ultimate truth. Not that emptiness is tacked on as something separate ... the object is the same


```
The Buddha says that all things have 2 aspects,
And they may be perceived correctly or falsely.
What is perceived correctly is ultimate truth,
And what is perceived falsely is conventional truth.

-Chandrakirti
```

Within every existant thing or event are 2 aspects... the aspect found by 'perceivers of reality', and those by 'perveivers of falsities'.

All things have these 2 aspects.

A perceiver of reality is called an 'ultimate mind'. The aspect found by such a mind is called an ultimate truth, emptiness, or thusness.

The aspect found by a *perceiver of falsities* is called a conventional truth.

There are not 2 different minds, just 2 different minds modes of inquiry.

## Illusion and Reality

###The relationship between the 2 minds

Understanding how the relative truth and the ultimate truth are related is a vital point in understanding the subtle line between illusion and reality.

For the lower schools, objects exist as real, and upon them is placed one characteristic; selflessness or emptiness.

First, we must be clear that conventional truth and ultimate truth are not the same. A phenomena like body is conventional truth, and it *has* an ultimate truth. There is phenomena that is both conventional and ultimate.

When we have a mind that realizes the final mode of existance of our 'I' -- which is its absense of inherent nature-- its emptiness or ultimate truth, we cannot simultaneously have a mind that realizes the conventional reality of our 'I.'

Understanding that my body is impermanent will immediately stop my grasping at it as permanent, because these 2 are mutually exclusive phenomena.

If we could have a good understanding of how the body is impermanent and is a product, that would go a long way towards losing attachment to the body.

Many masters such as Nagarjuna say that enormous fear arises as our sense of I and its real mode of existance become closer.

The false grasping at a sense of intrinsic identity creates fear as we feel we are losing identity and becoming non existant -- of course we are terrified. All that is happening is the appearance of the object and its acual mode of existance are getting closer together.

The buddhas do indeed perceive these 2 natures simultaneously in one object.

### How things exist

#### The truth that conceals

Generally we feel we can discern what's reality and whats not... the car we drive is real, while batman is not.. etc.

#### How things exist conventionally

It is necessary to differentiate between:

1. conventional truth
2. conventional existance - to exist dependent on causes and conditions

That empty interdependence is the mode of existance of all things, including all conventional truths and ultimate truths


How does one determine whether something exists conventionally?

1. It is known to a conventional consciousness - We know an object through our senses, and thats about as far as it goes.. not all objects of a conventionally consciousness exist however.
2. No other conventionally valid cognition contradicts it being so known
3. Reason that accurately analyzes the reality of whether something inherently exists does no contradict it.

We hold anything that fails to meet these criteria as non existant

So it cants be invalidated by another valid conventional consciousness or a mind analalyzing its final mode of existance, its emptiness.

**Without these 3 criteria a phenomenon cannot be said to conventionally exist**

In relation to the 3rd criteria, .. an ultimate mind will not contradict the convetional assertion that pleasure and pain arise conventionally from positive and negative actions, whereas it will contradict the conventional assertion that pleasure and pain arise from a creator god or a primal essence.
