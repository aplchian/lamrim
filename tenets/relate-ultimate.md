#Tenets

Base - how a particular school perceives the manner of existence of phenomena
Path - What should be adopted and what abandoned based on a thorough knowledge of the base
Result - Goal that a practioner attains through following the path

This is the standard template used in the monastaries to explain each school.

#Madhyamaka

Prasangika's do say external objects exist, but simply because they are perceived by a conventional valid cognition that is not investigating their ultimate nature.

Without any investigation, we normal people see books and chairs, and to us they exist. Therefore, they say on a conventional level, they exist.


### Real and Unreal Conventional Truths

There is a difference here in the Svatantrika and Prasangika.

**Svantrantika says there are 2 categories of conventional truths:**
1. real - tables, chairs, etc -- worldy beings take them as true because that is how they appear to their consciousness
2. unreal - things for which disparity exists between how they are and how they appear -- reflection of a face in a mirror, echo, magicians illusion, etc.

**Prasangikas make no such division -- for them all conventionalites are unreal.** For them, the face and the face in the reflection of the mirror are both deceptive because they appear to be inherently existant. 

They do accept there is a difference between the face and the reflection from the mundane view, though.

For Prasangikas, to apprehend something as a truth is to apprehend it as it actually exists.  **There must be full accordance between its mode of existance and it mode of appearance**

So, the Sva's say that on a worldly conventional level there is no mistake when a consciousness perceives an object as existing inherently. For the Pras there is no difference between truly existing and inherently existing... and both must be refuted.

## Ultimate Truth in Madhyamaka

### Emptiness

Both subschools asser that ultimate truth is the final mode of existance of things and events.

For the Svatantrikas that means the absense of true existance -- there emptiness.

Like the, the assert 2 types of emptiness -- of person, and of phenomenon. But unlike the Pras they do not assert that emptiness of phenomena is sunonumous with the complete cessation of suffering, the 3rd noble truth. For Pras, emptiness and cessation are the same thing. 

The Svatrantika texts usually use the term selflessness, and for them the path that leads to enlightenment is through an understanding of these 2 selflessnesses, of person and phenomena. The selfelessness of phenomena for them is the absence of true existance of phenomena, whereas the selflessness of person refers to the unfindability of a self among the 5 aggregates.. the same selflessnes that is found in the lower schools

The Sva's the pratyekabuddhas and sravakas must realize only the emptiness of true existance to achieve liberation, whereas for the Prasangikas these arhats must have a direct realization of emptiness.. which means not just realizing the absense of true existance ( the absense of causeless, concrete object within the inherent base and label ), but of *inherent* existance aswell -- the fact that there is no inherent nature within even the base and label.

Without the realzing the emptiness of both persons and phenomena there is no way to acheive liberation, and of course, enlightenment.

### The meaning of Paramarta Satya (ultimate truth)

While both schools agree that ultimate truth is the final mode of existance of things and events, they differ when it comes to actually explaining the term *ultimate truth*

In sanskrit, the term for ultimate truth is Paramarta Satya. In tibetan it is *dondam denpa*

For the Svatantrika's the ultimate is broken into 2 levels:
1. The objective, the supreme facts of the mode of existance (don)
2. The subjective, the mind apprehending it (dam)

The final mode of existance of the object, and the supreme mind apprehending the final mode of existance.

*Denpa* means truth in that there is no deception.

But when Prasangika's explain the term dondam they do not split it into these 2 of subject and object. Here .. 'dodam' is the *Supreme Fact* - the final mode of existance of an object is its lack of true and inherent existance. The Prasangika's therfore interpret truth from the objective side, not the subjective.

```

Since it is a fact[don] and it is supreme[dam pa] as well, it is ultimate [don dam]. And since it is true, it is the ultimate truth.

-Chandrakirti
```

Lama Tsongkhapa says that Chandrakirti does not maintain as do others that the uncontaminated wisdome of meditative equipose is the supreme and that the ultimate is its object. He instead maintains that 'ultimate truth' indicates both that it is a fact and that it is supreme. The respect in which ultimate truth is truth is that it is non deceptive.

### Ultimate Mind

What distinguishes ultimate from conventional truth is not the object, but it is the way the object is ascertained by the mind.

Analyzed by a conventional mind, the object is a conventional truth; analyzed my an ultimate mind, which sees the lack of inherent existanceof the object, it is in an ultimate truth. Not that emptiness is tacked on as something separate ... the object is the same


```
The Buddha says that all things have 2 aspects,
And they may be perceived correctly or falsely.
What is perceived correctly is ultimate truth,
And what is perceived falsely is conventional truth.

-Chandrakirti
```

Within every existant thing or event are 2 aspects... the aspect found by 'perceivers of reality', and those by 'perveivers of falsities'.

All things have these 2 aspects.

A perceiver of reality is called an 'ultimate mind'. The aspect found by such a mind is called an ultimate truth, emptiness, or thusness.

The aspect found by a *perceiver of falsities* is called a conventional truth.

There are not 2 different minds, just 2 different minds modes of inquiry.

## Illusion and Reality

###The relationship between the 2 minds

Understanding how the relative truth and the ultimate truth are related is a vital point in understanding the subtle line between illusion and reality.

For the lower schools, objects exist as real, and upon them is placed one characteristic; selflessness or emptiness.

First, we must be clear that conventional truth and ultimate truth are not the same. A phenomena like body is conventional truth, and it *has* an ultimate truth. There is phenomena that is both conventional and ultimate.

When we have a mind that realizes the final mode of existance of our 'I' -- which is its absense of inherent nature-- its emptiness or ultimate truth, we cannot simultaneously have a mind that realizes the conventional reality of our 'I.'

Understanding that my body is impermanent will immediately stop my grasping at it as permanent, because these 2 are mutually exclusive phenomena.

If we could have a good understanding of how the body is impermanent and is a product, that would go a long way towards losing attachment to the body.

Many masters such as Nagarjuna say that enormous fear arises as our sense of I and its real mode of existance become closer.

The false grasping at a sense of intrinsic identity creates fear as we feel we are losing identity and becoming non existant -- of course we are terrified. All that is happening is the appearance of the object and its acual mode of existance are getting closer together.

The buddhas do indeed perceive these 2 natures simultaneously in one object.

### How things exist

#### The truth that conceals

Generally we feel we can discern what's reality and whats not... the car we drive is real, while batman is not.. etc.

#### How things exist conventionally

It is necessary to differentiate between:

1. conventional truth
2. conventional existance - to exist dependent on causes and conditions

That empty interdependence is the mode of existance of all things, including all conventional truths and ultimate truths


How does one determine whether something exists conventionally?

1. It is known to a conventional consciousness - We know an object through our senses, and thats about as far as it goes.. not all objects of a conventionally consciousness exist however.
2. No other conventionally valid cognition contradicts it being so known
3. Reason that accurately analyzes the reality of whether something inherently exists does no contradict it.

We hold anything that fails to meet these criteria as non existant

So it cants be invalidated by another valid conventional consciousness or a mind analalyzing its final mode of existance, its emptiness.

**Without these 3 criteria a phenomenon cannot be said to conventionally exist**

In relation to the 3rd criteria, .. an ultimate mind will not contradict the convetional assertion that pleasure and pain arise conventionally from positive and negative actions, whereas it will contradict the conventional assertion that pleasure and pain arise from a creator god or a primal essence.
