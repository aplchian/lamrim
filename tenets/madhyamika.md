## Madhyamika - Dalai Lama

The lower schools define grasping at self-existance as the belief in this kind of discrete self - a self-sufficient and substantially real master that is in charge of the servant body-mind.

These schools interpretation of the 12 links defines fundamental ignorance as grasping at such a self-sufficient and substantially real self.

Madyhamikas would agree that gaining insight into selfless does open the way to reversing the cycle.

But, as Nagarjuna argues, while this is a form of grasping at self-hood, it does  not get at the subtlest meaning of selflessness. With insight into this grosser level of selflessness you can reverse some habits related to the grosser afflictions.. but wherever there is grasping at an intrinsic existance of the aggregates -- body and mind -- grasping onto a self or 'I' based on those aggregates will always be a danger.

```
As long as there is grasping at the aggregates,
there is grasping at a self;
when there is grasping at a self there is karma,
and from it comes birth

-Nagarjuna (Precious Garland)
```

Nagarjuna argues that just as grasping at the intrinsic existance of the person or self is fundamental ignorance, grasping at the intrinsic existance of the aggregates is also grasping at self-existance.

Madhyamikas therefore distinguish 2 types of ignorance:
1. **emptiness of self** - the lack of any self that is seperate from the aggregates
2. **emptiness of phenomenon** - the lack of the intrinsic existance of the aggregates themself.

To understand the meaning of the first link, fundamental ignorance, in its subtlest sense, we must identify and understand it as grasping at the intrinsic existance of all phenomena -- including the aggregates, sense spheres, and all external objects -- and not merely our sense of 'I'.

So what is the self?

Nagarjuna in his *Precious Garland* says that the person is not the earth element, water element, fire element, wind element, space, or consciousness... and apart from these, he asks, what could a person be? To this he responds that a person exists as the 'convergence' of these 6 constituents. Convergence susgest the interaction of the constituents in mutual interdependence.

How do we understand the concept of dependence?

```
What is it then? We posit the tathagata in dependence on the aggregates, for it cannot be asserted to be either identical with or seperate from the aggregates.

-Chandrakirti 
```
His point is that if we search for the essense of something, believing that we can pinpoint some real thing -- something objectively real from its own side that exists as a valid referent of the term or concept -- then we will fail to find anything at all.


## Time and The Self

When we search for what exactly time is, we can do so in 2 ways

1. Search believing that we will be able to find something objectively real that we can call 'time', but we will start running into problems.. we will see that time can only exist on the basis of something else, in relation to a particular phenomena or event
2. Search in a relative framework, not presuming an objective real entity

Take for example the present moment, if we search for the present moment, we wont be able to find anything. We find that events are either the past or the future. Nothing is truly present becaue the very process of searching for it itself a temporal process, which means that it is necessarily always at a remove from *now*.

If on the other hand, we search for the present within the relative framework of everyday convention, we can maintain the concept of the present.. ex. 'the present year' within the broader context of many years.

But, if we search for a real present that is present intrinsically we can not find it.

**In just same way we can ascertain the existance of a person within the conventional, relative framework without needing to search for some kind of objective, intrinsically real person that is the self. We can maintain our commensense notion of the person or individiual in relation to the physical and mental faculties that comprise our particular existance.**

Because of this, Nagarjuna refers to things and events or phenomena existing only as labels or within the framework of language and designation. Of the 2 possible modes of existance -- objectively real and nominal existance - objectively real existance is untenable, as we have seen. So, we can only speak of a self conventionally or nominally --- in the framework of language and consensus reality. 

**In brief - All phenomena exists merely in dependence on their name, through the power of worldy convention. Since they do no exist objectively, phenomena are referred to in the texts as 'mere terms', 'more conceptual constructs', and 'mere conventions'**

## Searching for the Self

```
If the self were the aggregates,
it would have arising and disintegration;
if it were different from the aggregates,
it would not have the characteristics of the aggregates

Nagarjuna - 18th chapter
```

If we are searching for the self, we must determind whether the self is identical to the aggregates or is something seperate from them.

If the self was identical to the aggregates it would be subject to arising and disintegration. If the body undergoes surgery, the self would also be cut or harmed. But if the self were completely independent, we could not explain any changes in the self based on changes in the aggregates.. such as when a person is first young then old, first sick, then healthy.

If the were completely distinct, then we could not account for the arising of grasping at the notion of self on the basis of the aggregates. 
ex. when our body is threatened we would not experience strong grasping at self as a result.


**The body is by nature an impermanent phenomena, always changing, but our idea of ths self is unchanging ..  we would never cofuse the 2 if they were indeed seperate**

Thus, neither within the aggregates or outside the aggregates can we find any tangible or real thing at all that we can call 'self'
