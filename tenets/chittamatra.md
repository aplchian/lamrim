# Chittamatra

## Texts used in Chittamatra

The mahayana tradition divides all the teachings of the Buddha into 3 'turnings of the wheel of dharma'

The discourses on the first turning suggest that phenomena exist from their own side. These take a pragmatic approach, focusing on the suffering that we all live with and how to reduce and eliminate it.

The Buddha's discourses on the second turning strongly assert that phenomena have no intrinsic nature; as a result, there is a seeming contradiction from the teachings on the first turning.

The sutras on the third turning address this contradiction. The specific sutras used by the Chittamatra school are considered to be part of the 3rd turning of the wheel.

The 3 main sutras they use are:

1. Buddha Nature Sutra - Tathaghatagarba Sutra
2. Sutra Unraveling the Thought - Samdhinirmochana Sutra
3. Descent into Lanka Sutra - Lankavatara Sutra

## Chittamatra's Base, Path, and Result

This school has 2 names:

1. Chittamatra - Mind Only School because the school rejects the existence of reality of objects beyond the mind that knows them.
2. Yogachara - Practice of Yoga - because the masters of this school justified their reasoning by referring to the insights they had gained in meditation.

Asanga is traditionally considered to be its founder. The ideas existed before him, but he brought them together systematically. According to the tibetan tradition he did not hold chittamatra views, but he most clearly showed the unique features of this schools philosophy.

The 2 lower schools talked about existent particles and such... They paint the picture of real objects apprehended by perception, in which the objects are external to an separate from the perceiving consciousness. Objects and consciousness are 2 different entities, and there is a causal relationship between them, the object being the cause of the consciousness, and the consciousness being the result.

The Chittamtra school refutes the existence of external objects. That doesn't mean they reject the existence of tables, chairs, and such. This school rejects the existence of external things that are *independent* of consciousness. The mind exists as an intrinsic truly existent reality, but external objects have no such intrinsic truly existing reality because they exist as objects of our known universe only in relation to the mind observing them.

For Chittamatrans, external phenomena and the mind perceiving them are not 2 entirely separate entities; instead they are 2 aspects of the same entity.

The object arises in dependence on the consciousness apprehending it, and the consciousness apprehending the object object arises in dependence on the object. Because they are not 2 entities but on, there is causal sequential relationship.

**This school is unique in that is asserts that all existent things are divided into three natures: dependent, perfect, and imputed -- all three of which are aspects of any single phenomena**

It is also unique in regard to how many consciousness it asserts. All the other schools place the number of consciousness at 6.-- 5 sense and one mental. **This school adds 2 more: the mind-basis-of-all and the afflictive mental consciousness, asserting that these must exist for karma to operate.**

They assert 2 types of selflessness or emptiness: 

1. selflessness of persons - almost identical to the previous schools
2. selflessness of phenomena - regarded as phenomenas perfect nature - the final mode of existence of an object, which in this school is the non duality of subject and object.

In addition to the 37 aspects of the path to enlightenment, the Chittamatra school emphasizes Bodhichitta and the 6 perfections.

They also assert full enlightenment , not just liberation as the result of the path. In full enlightenment, the practitioner attains the 2 bodies of a buddha, the form body and the truth body... rupakaya and dharmakaya... thus accomplishing the purposes of both self and others. The truth body is often further divided into 2: wisdom truth body(jnanakaya) and the natural truth body(svabhavikakaya); the form body is also further divided into 2: the enjoyment body(sambhogakaya) and the emanation body(nirmanakaya). 

## The Three Natures

They assert that all phenomena have three natures:

1. the dependent nature
2. the imputed nature
3. the perfect nature

### Dependent Nature

or 'other powered' -- an object that is the result of causes and conditions.

-

Every moment of mind is laden with karmic seeds. Some are ripening, while others are being created by our mental, verbal, and physical actions. Our whole universe and dictated by the creating and ripening of these seeds. The chittamatrans calls this the **causal flow**, which is the base upon which all else operates.

The dependent nature is what arises in our consciousness from the causal flow due to causes and conditions, and is apprehended as two polarities the subject(mind) and the object(object apprehended by the mind). To us it seems like the eye consciousness is here in the head and the pen is over there.  -- these are 2 distinct and very unrelated objects. To the chittamatrans there is a very strong connection. **Our experience of the pen-- of the flow of the pen-- and the pen itself are actually the same entity**. There is no difference between these two. 

**The flow of consciousness, from which the subjective and objective aspects arise, is the dependent nature**

Dependent natures include all impermanent phenomena. All the objects of the universe arise, abide, and disintegrate in conjunction with the consciousness that append them and are one entity with them.

### Imputed Nature

When we apprehend an object, its as if subject (our perception) and object (the object) are different entities, distinct and independent. This false distinction of subject and object is superimposed onto the object by the mind. So this is *imputed nature*. Furthermore, we almost always embroider our apprehension of the object in some way, by imputing properties and values onto it that it does not have. These 2 natures tie us to cyclic existence.

--

The apparent distinction between subject and object is a mistaken view that only comes about because of the conceptual, habituated aspect of our mind. 

**The appearance of the mind and its object as two separate, unconnected things, is the imputed nature** 

Subject and object are one entity, but we impute separateness onto them. 

Instead of seeing that the subject and object arise from the single flow of experience, we conceptualize different entities -- the object grasped by the mind and the mind that grasps the object. "Grasped" and 'grasper' are terms used by the chittamatra school. 

Instinctively, we *assume* that objects exist separate from the mind, but any investigation of objects necessarily involves mind in some way, so knowledge always has a subjective element. We know there is a pen, because we experience a pen. Thus, no object of knowledge exists apart from the mind experiencing it.

**Be careful though, you may think it is saying that the object does not exist at all. This is not correct. This school is simply asserting that external objects cannot exist as an object our universe without taking into account the mind experiencing them.**

Therefore, although the mind truly exists, the objects of its experience -- that is, all the objects that comprise the universe-- cannot truly exist because they rely on the mind, coming into being as projections of our perception, not as separate entities.

If the mind is inextricably involved with external objects, then it must also be the case with mental object, including the all-important concept of "I". Nothing exists in our world that is not an experience of mind. Object and mind are one entity.

**The dependent natures is the mind/object relationship, and the imputed nature is what we put on top of that perception.**

From the raw experience of the object, we impute the subject/object separation, and then on top of that all the other elements arise: labeling, judging, internal verbalizing, and myriad other conceptual minds. **The Chittamatra scholars say that language is what acts most powerfully to construct the imputed nature.**

Chittamatra's further divide the imputed nature into two: 

1. existent imputed nature - permanent phenomena such as unproduced space and abstractions -- things that are not products of causes and conditions.
2. non-existent imputed nature - the one we have been looking at -- subject and object as different entities, as well as seeing objects as established by their own character, and so on. They are also things that have no existence at all, conventionally or otherwise, such as much loved horns of the rabbit.



### Perfect Nature

Only when we become highly realized can we see that no such subject-object duality actually exists; this non duality is the *perfect*, or thoroughly established, nature of the object.
