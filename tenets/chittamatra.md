# Chittamatra

## Texts used in Chittamatra

The mahayana tradition divides all the teachings of the Buddha into 3 'turnings of the wheel of dharma'

The discourses on the first turning suggest that phenomena exist from their own side. These take a pragmatic approach, focusing on the suffering that we all live with and how to reduce and eliminate it.

The Buddha's discourses on the second turning strongly assert that phenomena have no intrinsic nature; as a result, there is a seeming contradiction from the teachings on the first turning.

The sutras on the third turning address this contradiction. The specific sutras used by the Chittamatra school are considered to be part of the 3rd turning of the wheel.

The 3 main sutras they use are:

1. Buddha Nature Sutra - Tathaghatagarba Sutra
2. Sutra Unraveling the Thought - Samdhinirmochana Sutra
3. Descent into Lanka Sutra - Lankavatara Sutra

## Chittamatra's Base, Path, and Result

This school has 2 names:

1. Chittamatra - Mind Only School because the school rejects the existence of reality of objects beyond the mind that knows them.
2. Yogachara - Practice of Yoga - because the masters of this school justified their reasoning by referring to the insights they had gained in meditation.

Asanga is traditionally considered to be its founder. The ideas existed before him, but he brought them together systematically. According to the tibetan tradition he did not hold chittamatra views, but he most clearly showed the unique features of this schools philosophy.

The 2 lower schools talked about existent particles and such... They paint the picture of real objects apprehended by perception, in which the objects are external to an separate from the perceiving consciousness. Objects and consciousness are 2 different entities, and there is a causal relationship between them, the object being the cause of the consciousness, and the consciousness being the result.

The Chittamtra school refutes the existence of external objects. That doesn't mean they reject the existence of tables, chairs, and such. This school rejects the existence of external things that are *independent* of consciousness. The mind exists as an intrinsic truly existent reality, but external objects have no such intrinsic truly existing reality because they exist as objects of our known universe only in relation to the mind observing them.

For Chittamatrans, external phenomena and the mind perceiving them are not 2 entirely separate entities; instead they are 2 aspects of the same entity.

The object arises in dependence on the consciousness apprehending it, and the consciousness apprehending the object object arises in dependence on the object. Because they are not 2 entities but on, there is causal sequential relationship.

**This school is unique in that is asserts that all existent things are divided into three natures: dependent, perfect, and imputed -- all three of which are aspects of any single phenomena**

It is also unique in regard to how many consciousness it asserts. All the other schools place the number of consciousness at 6.-- 5 sense and one mental. **This school adds 2 more: the mind-basis-of-all and the afflictive mental consciousness, asserting that these must exist for karma to operate.**

They assert 2 types of selflessness or emptiness: 

1. selflessness of persons - almost identical to the previous schools
2. selflessness of phenomena - regarded as phenomenas perfect nature - the final mode of existence of an object, which in this school is the non duality of subject and object.

In addition to the 37 aspects of the path to enlightenment, the Chittamatra school emphasizes Bodhichitta and the 6 perfections.

They also assert full enlightenment , not just liberation as the result of the path. In full enlightenment, the practitioner attains the 2 bodies of a buddha, the form body and the truth body... rupakaya and dharmakaya... thus accomplishing the purposes of both self and others. The truth body is often further divided into 2: wisdom truth body(jnanakaya) and the natural truth body(svabhavikakaya); the form body is also further divided into 2: the enjoyment body(sambhogakaya) and the emanation body(nirmanakaya).
