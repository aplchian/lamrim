# Sautrantika

This school claims to follow the sutras closely.

We mainly take the sautrantika assertions based on the base, path, and result from Dharmakirti's commentary on Dignagas *Compendium of Valid Cognition*.

The Path and Result differ very little from the Vaibashika's... the path mainly deals with the 37 aspects of the path to enlightenment, and the result is considered to be liberation instead of full enlightenments asserted in the later schools.

It is this schools assertion about the base that is especially significant. The prominence of Dharmakirti's Commentary on Valid Cognition within the gelug school is due to its comprehensive approach to epistemology and logic. The study of this school is crucial, because even though the later schools reject certain assertions, they nonetheless use this schools epistemological and logic tools.

On our spiritual journey we need to move from conceptual knowledge to direct experience of the subjects we are studying. The mechanics of how we accomplish this are the key points of the Sauntrantika presentation: what conceptual and perceptual consciousness' are, how they operate, and how we move from conceptualization to direct perception. These topics constitute a major part of the base as asserted by Sautrantikas.

## Existant Objects

### Things and Nonthings

The phenomena that exist in our universe are the base studied by this school.

The base is the material we work on, in order to develop the path so that we can achieve the result. If we have a clear idea of the base, it makes our path so much easier. 

The Vaibashikas, they are realist in that they assert try independently existing phenomena and that things and events are made up of aggregations of fundamental atoms (partless particles / moments of consciousness ). 

They believe that objects exist inherently or intrinsically and that existent objects can be divided into 2.

There are 2 types of valid cognition and therefore there are 2 types of existent objects. 

**Here we have the Sautrantika definition of what exists: it is that which is apprehended by a valid cognition**

2 Types of Valid Cognition: 

1. Direct Valid Cognition - cognize their object directly, such as an eye consciousness seeing a flower.
2. Inferential Valid Cognition - get at their object through reference, such as inferring fire through seeing smoke. 

From these 2 types of valid cognition there are 2 kinds of existent objects:

1. things - an object apprehended by a direct valid cognition
2. non-things - an object apprehended by a inferential valid cognition


These 2 **exist** because they are objects of a valid cognition.

**If an object is not apprehended by either type of valid cognition, then by definition is nonexistent.**

#### Nonthings

Existent objects that are conceptually constructed. This doesn't mean all conceptually constructed objects exist. So to differentiate, we need to clarify the term `valid cognition`

The tradition example of non existent objects are space flowers and horns on a rabbit. These are sheer fantasies and therefore not objects of valid cognition, direct or inferential. A more important example is the concept of `atman`, or self. If we explore the concept of self with valid cognition, we would see that it does not exist. 

Objects of conceptual mind that *do* exist are objects of valid inferences. 

for example, if you imagine an elephant sitting on a desk, of course the elephant doesn't exist. So, if you consider the non-existence of the elephant, the *absense of the elephant* is considered an existent object to this school. 

So thinking of a rabbit with horns is considered non valid and non existent, but thinking of the non existence of an elephant on the table is considered valid. 

So this may seem stupid to think about, but it becomes relevant when we start considering the non-existence of the 'I', which at all levels of buddhist thought is understood to be selfless.

 These 2 types of existence objects correspond quite closely to the division of phenomena that we saw earlier in the Vaibashika school, into compounded and uncompounded phenomena. They also correspond to another very important division:
1. Specifically Characterized Phenomena
2. Generally Characterized Phenomena


#### Specifically Characterized Phenomena

From the point of view of an apprehending mind, a thing is an object of a direct valid cognition, but objectively -- from the point of view of the object itself, a thing is a **specifically characterized phenomena** in that it has unique properties not shared other objects. This type of phenomena is unique and is perceived directly by the mind without an intermediary. 

**definition: a phenomena realized directly by the mind taking the phenomenon's unique characteristic as it's appearing object.**

so from this we can see that the object must be apprehended by our direct perception, not by our conceptual consciousness, and what the mind apprehends is unique characteristics of the object, not the general properties that is shares with other objects of the same type. **This is crucial, but it is not something that intuitively and immediately understand.**

only apprehended by direct perception

**The specific car that the eye perceives.**


#### Generally Characterized Phenomena

a Non thing is an object of a inferential valid cognition, and a generally **characterized phenomena**, in that it is a conceptual construct. As such it is called a **meaning generality** , which is an image reconstructed by the conceptual consciousness from a collage of images for the purpose of bringing the object to mind.

This is something the mind characterizes with a generality.

only apprehended by conception

**This is like bring to mind a later memory of a car, or the 'car-ness' of the car that the conceptual mind immediately overlays on the perception, is the generally characterized phenomena.**


----

```
The eye perceives something unique -- the specific object in front of me, which is the specifically characterized phenomena, but then the mind overlays this with the generalization of the objects category -- 'water glass' or 'vase' -- and that is the generally characterized phenomenon

Two glasses might even share the same features, but they are not the same object.
```

According to the Sautrantikas we can not get at a specifically characterized phenomena with words, as soon as we use words, we have fallen into a generality. 

```
Imagine  you have just come back from an amazing vacation. And in your mind you are recalling every moment of it in vivid detail.. can you say that's a direct perception? No, Its just a memory no matter how vivid, it is imperfect and incomplete. 
```

The Sauntrantika scholars are saying that words are by definition linguistic signs that allow us to mark objects only approxamitly so that we can make sense of the world. 


#### Real and Unreal Existent Objects

We can further refine our definition of existent objects. **Whether an existent phenomena is considered to be real or unreal depends on whether it can perform a function.**

Things that are Real are "real", because they can perform functions and bring about "real" results, whereas unreal things are "unreal" because they can't perform functions. 

```
Because all [real] things essentially abide in their own essence, 
they partake in the differentiation between [themselves and other] similar and dissimilar things.

-Dharmakirti 'Commentary on Valid Cognition'
```

from this quote we can see that real specifically characterized phenomena can be determined by three criteria

1. **place-specific** - they occupy a definite, special location. Nothing else can occupy that same space, like the table in front of me. Conceptual images are different. i can imagine the same location, but it occupies not actual location; it is constructed solely by mind. As such, it is an unreal thing, and generally characterized in this instance because it cannot occupy a definite specific location.
2. **cause-specific** - real specifically characterized phenomena come in to existence due to specific causes and conditions, unlike generally characterized phenomena which are conceptually constructed. The mind imagining an image of course has causes and conditions, but they are not the specific causes and conditions that brought the object into existence.
3. **time-specific** - they are locked into a specific time frame. Coming into and going out of existence at specific moments due to causes and conditions. Conceptually constructed objects on the other hand do not have that kind of clearly determined time and duration.


This is the meaning of the words "abide in their own essence" in the quotation.  
A specifically characterized phenomena abides in its own essence in the sense that it is not mixed with other things, either in their location, or causes, or time frame.

For Dharmakirti, an object that conforms to these 3 criteria is real. It is also an object of perception. 

A *thing* has additional properties aswell. Because of having these 3 characteristics and the ability to perform functions, a thing therefore possesses its own essence and is impermanent.

Because a *nonthing* does not possess these three features, it is unreal, it cannot function (hence, is noneffective), and is permanent.


**This is an interesting aspect of the Sautrantikas notion of generally characterized phenomena that separates them from the Vaibashikas**. A generally characterized object is an imputation(as we have seen), and that, say the Sautrantikas means it is permanent. This conflicts with Vaibashikas idea of permanence, where there are only 3 examples of permanent phenomena: non-analytical cessation, analytical cessation, and space. According to the Sautrantika view there are countless permanent phenomena.  **All concepts, which by definition do not perform a function, are permanent.**

Concepts include inferential valid cognitions as well as all the other non direct minds, many of which are quite deluded. 

Deluded or not, there is *always* some degree of distortion of objects that appear to the conceptual mind; such objects may seem real, but they are not. for ex. if i see the buddha statue on my shrine, and then think of it when i don't see it, that image that appears may seem vivid and real, but it is not.. it is composed of distillations of all the images of the statue I have stored in my mind. So it is a generally characterized phenomena.

**Finally, a *thing*, which has all these aspects, is also an ultimate truth, whereas a nothing is a conventional truth.**

to sum up the existent objects according to the Sautrantika school

| Things                               | NonThings                             |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| real                                 | unreal                                |
| functioning                          | nonfunctioning                        |
| effective                            | noneffective                          |
| specifically characterized phenomena | generally characterized phenomena     |
| objects of direct valid cognition    | objects of conceptual valid cognition |
| ultimate truths                      | conventional truths                   |


- Something is real because it functions
- something is specifically characterized because it is an object of direct valid cognition
- something is effective because it functions and is therefore a specifically characterized phenomena

**We can rove around this list seeing the logical connections between the various terms and in this way, clarify the distinctions between ultimate truths and conventional truths in the Sautrantika**
