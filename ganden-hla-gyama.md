# Ganden Hla Gyama

།དགའ་ལྡན་ལྷ་བརྒྱའི་མགོན་གྱི་ཐུགས་ཀ་ནས།

 །རབ་དཀར་ཞོ་གསར་སྤུངས་འདྲའི་ཆུ་འཛིན་རྩེར།

 །ཆོས་ཀྱི་རྒྱལ་པོ་ཀུན་མཁྱེན་བློ་བཟང་གྲགས།

 སྲས་དང་བཅས་པ་གནས་འདིར་གཤེགས་སུག་སོལ།



**I am requesting you, the Dharma King, Omniscient One, Losang Dragpa, and Sons,**

**Who are seated on top of the water holders like piled up white curd, to descend here at this place**

**From the heart of the saviors of the hundred devas of tushita.**



Think as you have gone to the pure realm and are making the request.

"I don't have the fortune in this life to come to your pure realm and actually meet you; therefore plase come down to the southern continent, Dzambuling, to my guide, my savior, my Refuge"

If you say this prayer slowly and with a melody,  there is no need to doubt at all that Tsognkhapa will come before you. This is because he has acheived the great path of merit where he has clairvoyance to hear from very far. So it is impossible that he cannot hear you.

The transacednetal wisdom that you have visualized at the heart of matreya descends: Lama Tsongkhapa onto Lama Tsongkhapas crown. Gyaltsab Rinpoche onto Gyaltsap Rinpoches crown, Khedrup Rinpoche onto Khedrup Rinpoches Crown. They are absorbed and they become oneness, and that oneness is stabalized.
