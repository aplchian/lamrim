# Valid Establishment



## The debate about whether external objects cause sense consciousnesses

Candrakirti and Bhavavika both accept external objects, but the way that they posit the subtle sense organs and their objects is completely different. Bhav says there is an inherently existent sense organ and object. Chandra says neither is inherently existent. He says, that like consciousness, they have an imputed nature. 

The Prasangikas define direct perceiver in a completely different way than the lower schools. For them, **direct** མངོན་སུམ། is virtually synonymous with **manifest** མངོན་འགྱུར།་ 



.. goes on to explain how the Prasangikas view of direct perception is different than lower schools.. confusing...



Prior to attaining buddhahood, any awareness that is not the direct realization of shunyata, is mistaken in that its object appears to exist inherently. 

## Conventional and Ultimate Objects and their Respective Objects

Just because the sense consciousnesses are mistaken in regard to inherent existence, it doesn't mean that they are not valid. They are valid regarding the particular objects themselves, such as forms, sounds, and so on. 

The sense consciousnesses are only mistaken from the perspective of ultimate knowledge. 

*Conventional Truth* means, true from the perspective of ignorance — the total obscurer.

Things that are true for a mind obscured by ignorance are conventional truths. 

From a prasangika perspective, a conventional consciousness is one that is not directly perceiving shunyata.

Here the prasangikas are asserting two types of conventional consciousness:

1. **distorted conventiontality** - a conventional consciousness that could otherwise know that its object does not exists as it appears — seing a reflection as a face
2. **correct conventionality** - a conventional consciousness that could not otherwise know that its object does not exist as it appears — seeing a table as inherently existent

It is only after engaging in ultimate analysis and understanding emptiness that one can understand that a valid conventional sense consciousnesses as well as their objects are mistaken



In sum, the objects of sense consciousnesses are true in a conventional sense, even though they are false (i.e conventional) objects.



**Need to think and summarize this based on the last paragraph summary**

There is no contradiction in saying that from the point of view of ignorance, conventional things are true — yet from the point of view of a refined conventional knowledge that understands things to be nontrully existent and merely nominally existent, conventional things are false.
