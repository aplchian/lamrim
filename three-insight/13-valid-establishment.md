#13 Valid Establishment

## B. You cannot eradicate conventional phenomena by refuting them through investigating whether valid cognition establishes them

**What Candrakirti refutes is that visual consciousness and such are not valid with regard to a special object - reality - and not that they are valid with regard to other objects.**

If visual consciousness' were correct, what need would their be for noble beings? The worldy beings would be able to see reality.

If a sensory consciousness is unimpaired -- that is, no eye disease or other internal or external cause of error is affecting it -- then it is accurate in conventional terms. It is mistaken in terms of appearance because, under the influence of ignorance, it apprehends its object as though it were intrinsically existent -- which it is not. **Yet this does not contradict its conventional accuracy.**

```
It is quite inconsistent to call sensory consciousness 'perception' and also to consider it valid with regard to other things. As the world sees it, a valid cognition is simply a non-deceptive consciousness. However, the Bhagavan has said that even a consciousness, because it is a composite, has a false and deceptive quality and is like a magicians illusion. That which has a false and deceptive quality and is like a magicians illusion is not non-deceptive, because it exists in one way but appears in another. It is not right to designate such a valid cognition because it would then absurdly follow that all consciousness would be valid cognition.

Candrakirti Commentary on the 400 Stanzas
```

This refutation of the position that the visual consciosnesses and such are both perceptions and valid cognitions is a refutation of the assertion of th logicians.

```
In order to teach these logicians, you question them closely.

Q: What is a perception in your system?
A: A consciousness is a perception.

Q: What sort of consciousness?
A: On that is free of conceptuality

Q: What is this conceptuality?
A: It is the fluctuation and discrimination that is involved in the superimposition of names and types of objects. Because they are free from that, the 5 sensory consciousness engage only in the inexpressible intrinsic character of their objects. They are therefore called 'perceptions'.
```

Hence, the logicians hold that a perception is a consciousness that is free from conceptuality and non-mistaken. It is non-mistaken in that it apprehends the intrinsic character of the object just as it is. Thus, all 5 consciousness comprehend the instrinsic characteristics of forms, sounds, etc.. this intrinsic nature is the object of these consciousnesses. Therefore it is in relation to the intrinsic character of these five objects they they consider such perceptions to be valid.

Candrakirti doesnt accept even conventionally that anything exists essentially or by way of its intrinsic character. **Thus, how could he accept that sensory consciousnesses are valid in regard to the intrinsic character of their objects?**  

**Therefore, this refutation of the claim that sensory consciousnesses are valid is a refutation of the view that they are valid with regard to the intrinsic character of of the five objects.**

This refutation is made by way of the Bhagavans statement that consciousness is false and deceptive. 

In what sense is it deceptive? -- as Candrakirti puts it.. "it exists in one way, but appears in another." **This means that the 5 objects.. form, sound, etc -- are not established by way of their intrinsic character, but appear to the sensory consciousnes as if they were. Therefore those consciousnesses are not valid with regard to the intrinsic character of their objects.**

In brief, what Candrakirti intended in this passage is that the sensory consciousnesses are not valid with regard to the intrinsic character of the 5 objects because they are deceived in relation to the appearance of intrinsic character in the five objects. This is because those 5 objects are empty of intrinsic character, yet appear to have it. For example, it is like a consciousness that perceives 2 moons. 

The essentialists say well, if the objects didn't have intrinsic existance, then they would be non-things, devoid of any capacity to function. They therefore assert that if the sensory consciousnesses are not valid perceptual cognitions of the intrinsic character of the 5 objects, then there can be no valid cognition of the 5 objects, but if the sensory consciousnesses are valid cognitions of the 5 objects, then they will be valid cognitions of the intrinsic character of those objects.

Also, perceivers of falsities are of two types:
Those with clear sensory faculties and those with imparied sensory faculties.
A consciousness with an impaired sensory faculty
Is considered wrong in relation to a consciousness with a good sensory faculty.
Those objects known by the world
And apprehended with the six unimparied sensory faculties
Are true for the world. The rest
Are posited as unreal for the world.

Candrakirti Commentary on the Middle Way
```

Conventional consciousnesses and their objects are of two types: accurate in relation to conventional consciousness and inaccurate in relation to conventional consciousness. 

**internal conditions** that impair the sensory faculties -- eye disease, jaundice, etc.
**external conditions** that impair the sensory faculties -- water, mirrors, sounds from caves, sunlight at certain times of the day.. as for what impairs the mental sensory faculties is incorrect tenets and false reasoning. Sleep also degrade the mental consciousness associated with dreams and so forth.

In this context you should not consider the impairment of being affected by ignorance to be a cause of impairment in this context -- even thought the object apprehended by ignorance does not exist even conventionally, as will be explained below.

Candrakirti does not assert that contingent entities have intrinsic character or intrinsic nature even conventionally.
