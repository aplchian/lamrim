# 16. Not Negating Enough

## Refuting an overly restricted identification of the object to be refuted

### Q: In some Madhyamika texts it says that if a thing were to exist truly it would:

1. Not be caused by causes and conditions
1. immutable
1. Posited without depending on other phenomenon


Answer:

**So when identifying the object o be negated, we must identify the fundamental object to be negated**

When you negate the fundamental object of negation, then the Madhyamika view arises in your mind, that objects lack inherent existance.

But just using these 3, even the other schools would agree that objects lack intrinsic nature, how could Madhyamika be unique?

**These statements just show fallacies that would come if things existed essentially. They do not identify the object of negation on its own terms.**

For example, a pot is impermanet, but impermanence is not the proper meaning of a pot.

If something existed ultimately it would have to be a partless thing, but we do not suggest that 'partless thing' is the fundamental object of negation.

Such notions of 'partless' are not the fundamental cause that binds beings to cyclic existance.

So, perfect, optimal, and direct knowledge of the partlessness, would not overcome the innate afflictions.

**Thus, when making philisophical determinations, make your principle task to determine that an object as conceived by innate ignorance does not exist**

So the real refutation is the refutation of the existance of an object conceived by innate ignorance. Not the refutation of an object based on these philisophical tenets. It wont bring you anywhere.

It would be extremely absurd to claim that you can overcome innate afflictions by seeing as non-existance the 2 selves imputed by acquired misconception.

~~
So there are 2 levels of ignorance, a gross acquired, and a deeper innate level.

Notes:

Watched a video of Thubten Jinpa explaining from is emptiness / emptiness is form.

What he said is that form is emptiness, which is clear, but what it means by emptiness if form, is that emptiness actually isnt inherintly existant, but only in relation to form.
```

.. back to it

So, what does not exist is the object conceived by innate ignroance, but you should use the 3 refutations above in support of this.

You have to eradicate the perspective of innate ignorance. Otherwise you would just be refuting imputations of philisophical tenets and it will be a very shallow understanding. 

### Q: Buddha and Nagarjuna spoke of a 'Nature', saying this is the reality of 'phenomena'. Is this nature hypothetical or does it actually exist?

A: It does exist. Chandrakirti says:

```
It's the reality which the Bhagavan spoke extensively. Whether Tathaghatas appear or not, the reality of phenomena remains. What is this reality?

It is the nature of things such as these eyes. And what is this nature? It is that in them which is neither fabricated or dependent upon somethingelse, it is their identity as known by knowledge free from the impairment of ignorance. Does it exist or not? If it did not exist why would the bodhisattva's cultivate the path and go through much hardship in order to know reality?

Chandrakirti
```

### Q: You said previously that all phenomena lack intrinsic nature.

A: This is true, as we have said so many times before. Even reality, the ultimate truth has no intrinsic nature at al.

```
The `final nature` is the unfabricated fundamental entity which is ineluctably present in fire in the past, present, and future; it is not the later occurance of something that was not there before. It doe snot depend on causes and conditions like heat or water, or long or short, or here or there. Does fire have such a nature? It neither essentially has it, nor essentially lacks it. Nevertheless, to avoid frightening listeners I reify it and say, "It exists conventionally"

Chandrakirti
```

Thus chandrakirti refutes the view that this nature exists essentially; he says it exists conventionally.

So if it did not exist, you would have to hold that in Madhyamika, it is impossible to attain freedom.

To attain nirvana means to perceive nirvana. When you attain nirvana, you must perceive the ultimate truth of cessation.

"Fabricated means "produced" in the sense of a new occurence of something that did not exist before.

If eyes and such were their own nature, then pure conduct would be senseless because even innacurate consciousness could know that nature. Because they are not their own nature, pure conduct for the sake of viewing tht nature does have a purpose. This nature is nonfabricated and does not depend on something else.

When an ordinary being finds the emptiness of a phenomena, we see that as an aspect of that phenomena. Since you have not stopped dualistic appearance, that emptiness is a nominal, rather than actual ultimate truth.

Accustoming yourself to this will make mistaken appearnces stop. The consciousness would not perceive substrata such as form.

**An ultimate truth is posited, where in addition to the stilling of all elaborations of essential existance, there is also a sheer stoppage of all elaborations of mistaken appearances, appearances of intrinsic existance where there is none. Thus, while we assert a final nature, how could we be forced to accept an essentially existant final nature?**


```
Due to ignorance, ordinary beings perceive a certain aspect in thing. As noble beings who are free from the impairments of ignorance do not see that mistaken aspect, there is something else that serves as their object. That very entity is posited as the final nature of those things.

Chandrakirti
```

```
Things lack of intrinsically existant production is not anything. This, it is just a non-thing. It has no essence. Therefore it is not the intrinsic nature of things.

Chandrakirti
```

The ultimate truth is the sheer elimination of the elaborations of the objects of negation, the 2 selves.

Some think the ultimate exists under its own power.

**Conclusion: You should work on the method for eradicating the way that ignorance apprehends things. This ifnornace being the root that 'binds' you to cyclic existance. So you should rely on Nagarjuna and his son Aryadeva and cross to the other side of cyclic existance.**

To avoid missteps in reaching the Madhyamika view, it is most crucial to refute wrong ideas about the object of negation.
