# Conventional Existence

Whatever conventional knowledge knows to be false is not a conventional truth.



When Nagarjuna says that "I do not have any thesis because I do not accept things", We should not take that literally. His point is that nothing can be accepted when based upon the assumption that things have an inherent nature or exist by their own nature. He is not saying that nothing can be accepted at all.



**The whole wrong view that the goal is to meditate without thoughts,etc is wrong because it does not identify the object to be negated by ultimate analysis, namely, inherent existence.** Those who identify the object of negation too broadly destroy the establishment of all conventional things.



**So what does it mean to say that something is conventionall existent, or conventionally non-existent?** We cannot say that a thing is boht existent and non-existent; there must be some special quality that distinguishes these categories.

**There are three criteria for something to exist conventionally:**

1. it is known by conventional knowledge
2. the thing known in that way is not contradicted by another conventional valid knowledge
3. it is not negated by ultimate knowledge analyzing ultimate reality, which investigates whether or not something has inherent existence.

**Anything that satisfies these criteria is conventionally existent, and anything that doesnt, doesn't exist at all.**

If something doesnt exist conventionally, then that is sufficient for it to not exist at all. But if something doesn't exist ultimately that isn't a sufficient condition for it to not exist. **There is nothing that exists ultimately according to the madhyamika system. To *exist* means to exist conventionally.**



## The first criterion (it is known by conventional knowledge)

Conventional knowledge is a consciousness that knows an ordinary thing, such as a tree, just as it appears to sense consciousness. It knows without analyzing in which way the object exists. When we see a jar we dont ask, is it real?.. what's its nature? Conventional valid awareness simply engages its object as it appears without further examination. It doesnt actually have to be completely free from examination though. it can examine an analalyze things in a conventional manner. it can see seomething in the distance and try to figure out what it is.. is it a man or tree? Also analyzing impermanance. The main thing is, the anaysis isnt looking for ultimate identity or reality of something that appears. 

## The second criterion (the thing known in that way is not contradicted by another conventional valid knowledge)

If one valid understanding were to perceive something, while another were valid understanding knew it to be the opposite, then one understanding would negate the other. If something were contradicted in this manner, then it could not be conventionally existent. 

For example, a conventional consciousness that sees a rope as a snake. It would be negated by a conventional valid consciousness that sees there is no snake. 

Vaid knowing contradicts incorrect belief.

**If something is affirmed by valid knowledge, then it exists conventionally. Whatever is negated by valid knowledge does not exist at all, not even conventionally; it is totally non-existent.**

You may wonder then, why one wins out over the other.. wouldnt they both hurt each other? Dharmakirti says that the one will win because it is based on truth. At first they struggle, but eventually the one based on truth will win out.



## The third criterion (it is not negated by ultimate knowledge analyzing ultimate reality, which investigates whether or not something has inherent existence.)

Any conventionally existent thing must be established by conventionally valid knowledge and it must not be negated by ultimate valid knowledge. **In addition it must definitly not be proved by ultimate valid knowledge, because if it were found by correct ultimate analysis, then it would be truly, or inherently existent… this would contradict it being a conventional thing.**

**So, conventional things can neither be established, or negated by ultimate analysis.**

It is wrong to confuse:

1. not being contradicted by a reasoning consciousness
2. being established by a reasoning consciousness

A conventional thing, something that is commonly known, is accepted just as it is known by ordinary common sense. It would be innapropriate to try to establish it by analyzing whether or not it exists inherently.



## The object as it appears and the object as it is held or understood	

here just talks about difference between mistaken appearance and being held correctly..

If it's held object cannot be negated by valid knowledge, then it is correct.

The Prasangikas say that the sense consciousnesses are mistaken, because the nang yul appears to exist inherently. However, it is not wrong.

Sautrantikas say that sense consciousnesses are not mistaken.

Yogacaras agree with madhyamikas and say sense consciousnesses are mistaken, but their reasoning is different. When we see blue, we see it as an external object. To them, all sense consciousnesses are mistaken with regard to this subject-object duality. However, it is not wrong, because the primary object is blue, not the appearance of duality. Therefore it is valid knowledge because it is not mistaken with regard to the principal held object. 

So in summary for the Prasangika, for a mind to be conventionally valid, its held object cannot be refuted by another valid conventional consciousness — holding impermant things to be permanent, impure things as pure, selfless things as having a self, and things in the nature of suffering as being pleasurable are all refuted by meands of negating their held object. 

However, the held objects of correct ways of thinking do exist conventionally and cannot be negated with valid reasoning. 

From the point of view of the ultimate however, there is no differentiation between distored and correct conventionalities because neither of them exist ultimately. If we hold things to be ultimately, inherently, or truly existent, then we are employing signs. — "things are not permanent or impermanent, pleasurable or not pleasureable… you should not view things in any of those ways."

## Conventional Truth Exists Conventionally

In general, existent means conventionally existent and non-existent means not conventionally existent — it does not be 'not ultimately existent'

The term *true* refers only to what is true from the perspective of a mind obscured by ignorence. That is conventional truth, and it is just conventionally existent.

Arhats and Bodhisattvas on the 8th bhumi have totally eliminated afflicted ignorance — the afflictive mind that obsctructs liberation. In terms of absense of ignorance, bodhisattvas on the 8th level are equal to arhats and pratyekabuddha arhats. 

**These 3 types of beings see conventional appearances** The Bodhisattvas still need to get rid of the subtle imprints left by ignorance. These imprints are an obstructive force called *ignorance*, even though they are not consciousness. **They give rise to a subtle appearance of things existing inherently.** These imprints and false appearance they give rise to are called *obstructions to omniscience.*(ཤེས་སྒྲིབ)

So, they do not grasp at things as inherently existent. During post meditation, everything has an illusion like nature, yet things still appear as inherently existent, but they know things do not exist that way. Therefore, appearing things for them are said to be *mere conventionalities* (ཀུན་རྫོབ་ཚམ)
