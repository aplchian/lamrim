# Conventional Existence

Whatever conventional knowledge knows to be false is not a conventional truth.



When Nagarjuna says that "I do not have any thesis because I do not accept things", We should not take that literally. His point is that nothing can be accepted when based upon the assumption that things have an inherent nature or exist by their own nature. He is not saying that nothing can be accepted at all.



**The whole wrong view that the goal is to meditate without thoughts,etc is wrong because it does not identify the object to be negated by ultimate analysis, namely, inherent existence.** Those who identify the object of negation too broadly destroy the establishment of all conventional things.



**So what does it mean to say that something is conventionall existent, or conventionally non-existent?** We cannot say that a thing is boht existent and non-existent; there must be some special quality that distinguishes these categories.

**There are three criteria for something to exist conventionally:**

1. it is known by conventional knowledge
2. the thing known in that way is no contradicted by another conventional valid knowledge
3. it is not negated by ultimate knowledge analyzing ultimate reality, which investigates whether or not something has inherent existence.

**Anything that satisfies these criteria is conventionally existent, and anything that doesnt, doesn't exist at all.**

If something doesnt exist conventionally, then that is sufficient for it to not exist at all. But if something doesn't exist ultimately that isn't a sufficient condition for it to not exist. **There is nothing that exists ultimately according to the madhyamika system. To *exist* means to exist conventionally.**
