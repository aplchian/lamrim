# 5 Dependent Arising and Emptiness



Madhyamaka specifies what is negated and then clearly shows what is left over — conventional reality.

Madhyamaka clearly makes the link between conventional reality and ultimate reality. Which is — **Everything is empty of being inherently existent because of being dependent, and everything is dependent because of being empty of inherent existence.**

Both permanent and impermanent things are dependent:

**Permanent**:

1. on its parts
2. on being imputed by the mind on suitable basis

**Impermanent**:

1. on its parts
2. on being imputed by the mind on suitable basis
3. on causes and conditions



## b'' How those systems contradict the distinguishing feature of the Madhyamika

Here Tsongkhapa debates with earlier Madhyamikas. 

It seems basically what is being argued here is that the opponent says that if things didn't inherently exist at all, then how could there be samsara, nirvana, etc. Nothing would function. Tsongkhapa asserts the opposite… that if things were not empty of inherent existence, they could not function. There could be no suffering… suffering depends on causes and conditions. Because suffering is dependent on causes and conditions then you can assert the cessation, by stopping it's causes. The whole path is possible because of emptiness. 

They say Chandrakirti says that the teachings samsara, nirvana, etc are made conventionally, which they accept as well. Tsongkhapa says that they will also have to accept that Chandrakirti says things dont exist inherently even conventionally. The argument refuting intrinisic existence must refute it even conventionally. So, in your system if you refute intrinisic existence conventionally, then you will have to refute bondage, freedom, and so forth even conventionally. 

**If you claim that the absence of intrinsic existence contradicts bondage, freedom, production, cessation, etc. then it will be impossible in terms of either truth to give the full correct teachings on nirvana and cyclic existence within emptiness, the emptiness of inherent existence. Therefore you have denied the unique feature of the Madhyamika.**

**Dependent arising is the best reason to use in order to know the absence of intrinsic existence.** Only Madhyamikas have this unique approach.

**The intelligent should develop and unshakeable certainty that the very meaning of emptiness is dependent-arising.**

**This is how dependent arising bestows certain knowledge of the absence of intrinsic existence; this is how it dawns of you that it is things which are devoid of intrinsic existence that are causes and effects.**

## c'' How a Madhyamika responds to those who contradict the distinguishing feature of Madhyamika

The main point is that total nonexistance and emptiness of inherent existence are not the same. 

Nagarjuna says that the consequence of asserting that things exist by their own nature is that one must accept that things exist without causes and condition

A Realist believes that if things do not exist in terms of their own essential nature, or inherently, they must be completely nonexistent, like a donkey horn. If something exists, it exists inherently; if inherent existence is negated, then nothing exists at all. **So on one hand, they fall to the extreme of eternalism, and on the other, they fall to the extreme of nihilism. As a result, they cannot reconcile conventional and ultimate truth.**

"Dependent Arising" — **Dependent** because they don't arise by themselves. They arise based on something else. **Arising** shows that things are not totally non-existent, they do infact arise as existents. 

**All functioning things arise in dependence on causes and conditions and function to produce their own effects.** Like a a magical illusion of a an elephent. It arises from a magician, shadow, audience, etc.

**In summary, through properly understanding dependent arising, both the extremes of eternalism and nihilism are cleared away at the same time.**

The Earlier madhyamikas allow themselves 3 alternatives for how something exists. They say something could:

1. exist
2. not exist
3. neither exist nor not exist

But, when we examine whether things inherently exist, we are left with 2 possibilites. It either inherently exists or does not inherently exist.

> If it negates "Not inherent existent",
>
> Then it proves "Inherent Existent"
>
> -Nagarjuna Refutation of Objections

This is a powerful rejection of the view that things are not existent,  not nonexistent, not both, not neither.
