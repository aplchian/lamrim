# 12. Rational Analysis

So the next 4 sections show how the Madhyamika critique does not eradicate conventional existance.

There are 4 parts.

1. You cannot eradicate conventional phenomena by refuting them through investigating whether they are capable of withstanding rational analysis. (ch 12)
1. You cannot eradicate conventional phenomena by refuting them through investigating whether valid cognition establishes them. (ch. 13 - 14)
1. You cannot eradicate conventional phenomena by refuting them through investigating whether they are produced in one of four alternative ways [from self, other, both, or neither]..(ch 15)
1. A refutation of all four parts of the tetralemma -- things exist, things do not exist, and so forth- is not a legitimate critique of conventional phenomena

## 1. You cannot eradicate conventional phenomena by refuting them through investigating whether they are capable of withstanding rational analysis. (ch 12)

Madhyamikas do not assert that the production of forms and such can withstand analysis by reasoning, so they avoid the fallacy that there are truly existance things.

**Q: If these things cannot withstand rational analysis, then how is it possible for something to exist when reason has refuted it?**

A: There is a difference between the inability to withstand rational analysis with invalidation by reason.

To ask whether something can withstand rational analysis is to ask whether it is found by a line of reasoning that analyses reality.

```
Our analysis is intent on seeking intrinsic nature

Chandrakirti
```

**So, this analysis is looking to see if forms and so forth have production and cessation that exist essentially, it is not that this line of reasoning searches for mere production and cessation**

When such a line of reasoing analyses or searches for production and so forth, it does not find a trace of them. They are unable to withstand analyses.

**However, just because this line of reasoning cant find them, it doesn't mean it refutes them. But rather, reason refutes something that if it did exist would have to be established by reason, but which reason does not establish.**

Conventional consciousness establish the production and cessation of forms and such, although forms and such exist, reasoning consciousness do not establish them, so if reasoning consciousness cannot find forms and such, how could it refute them?

**For example, a visual consciousness does not find sounds, but this does not refute them. This is similar.**

So just because a reasoning consciousness cant establish it, that doesnt mean it refutes it.

So, if there were essentially existant production, cessation, etc. Reason would have to find it because it accurately analyzes whether forms and such have these. But it does not find it and refutes any essential production / cessation.

If they existed essentially, the analysis would have to find them, but it does not.

**So, just because Madhyamika analysis does not find essentially existent production, that doesnt mean it refutes 'mere' production.**

**In this way, objects, sensory faculties, and consciousness have no instrinsic existance.**

Chandrakirti repeatedly allows these conventionalities such as forms to exist. However, they are not in the least estabished by reasoning that analyzes reality, that is, analyzes whether they have instrinsic nature.

**So, with the reasoning to find if something has intrinsic nature would find it if it was there, but if it does not find it, that does not refute its mere existance.**

Chandrakirti often says that it is those who are incompetenet at positing conventionalities who claim that conventionalities are destroyed when, upon rational analysis, reason does not find them.

How coud a noble being in meditative equipose who does not see the production and cessation of forms and so forth, but how could it see production / cessation as non-existant?

**Reasoning that analyzes whether things have intrinsic nature does not find production and do forth, but it does not consider production and so forth to be nonexistant.**

Earlier scholars and present scholars have erred by not differentiating, and instead considering identical, the following pairs:

1. something unable to withstand rational analysis **vs.** something invalidated by reason
1. the non perception of production and cessation by a noble beings wisdom of meditative equipose **vs.** the perception of production and cessation as non existant by a noble beings widom of meditative equipose
1. the non-discovery of production and cessation by a reasoning consciousness which analyzes whether they instrinsically exist **vs.** the discovery that production and cessation are non exisant.

**Therefore the intelligent should analyze this in detail and make careful distinctions!**

So, reason does not refute conventionalities

Chandrakirti says that what is commonly known in the world contradicts any attempt to refute them.

Consequently, when essentialists use rational analysis to refute conventional phenomena, such as external objects, reason does not find those conventional phenomena, but it does not contradict them.

**Thefore, reason refutes essential existance -- objective existance found on the side of the thing itself; it does not refut mere existance**

So, a refutation by such an analysis is a refutaton of intrinsic existance, hence, distinguish these 2. 

The learned do not subject worldly objects to this type of analysis, instead they accept that worldy objects are simply the inconceivable results of karma.

**They accept the whole world as though it were an emanation projected by another emanation**

So when you present the 2 truths, does the line of reasoning that establishes teh ultimate contradict the presntation of the conventional? IF it does, then your presentation of the 2 truths contradicts itself.

**There should be no trace of internatl contradiction in your presentation of the 2 truths.**
