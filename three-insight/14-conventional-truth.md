#14 Conventional Existeence

WEe Madhyamikas posit conventionally, within our own system, many presentations of cyclic existence and nirvana; we also refute the conventional existence of constructs that are put forward as unique assertionas by essentialists. As this is extremely difficult, accurate knowledge of the presentation of the two truths scarcely exists.

How does one determine whether something exists conventionally?

We hold that something exists conventionally if

1. it is known to a conventional consciousness
1. if no other conventional valid cognition contradicts its being as it is thus known
1. if reason that accurately analyzes reality -- that is, whether something intrinsically exists -- does not contradict it.

**We hold that what fails to meet these criteria does not exist**

In a sense, the conventional consciousness operates in a non-inquisitive manner. It operates only within the context of how a phenomena appears to it, without analyzing, "Is this how the object actually exists, or does it just appear this way to my mind?". It operates in the context of how things appear, how they are known, to a worldly or conventional consciousness. Therefore it is called mundane knowledge.

This kind of consciousness occurs in all person, whether or no they have become involved in philisophical tenet systems. Thus, no matter whose mindstream it occurs in, this is called "Mundane knowledge" or "Non analytical consciousness"

Ordinary people do not understand karm and its effects, the levels and paths, or such mattters, but they hear about and experience them, thereby taking them as objects. As this is so, they appear to even ordinary consciousnesses that are not analyzing how things actually exists. We thus avoid the fallacy that these would not be things that the world knows.

**Other conventional valid cognitions no not contradict that which exists conventionally. Ex: a consciousness that does not analyze how things exist may think that a rope is a snake or tha a mirage is water. However, conventional valid cognition does contraduct the objects apprehended by such consciosnesses, so those objects do not exist even conventionally.**

A reasoning consciosuness that accurately analyzes whether something instrinsically exists does not contradict that which exists conventionally.

Whatever a reasoning consciousness establishes as existing must exist essentioally, so it is contradictory for such to be a conventional object. So it is wrong to confuse the two

There is a difference between:

1. not being contradicted by a reasoning consciousness
1. being established by a reasoning consciousness

Such confusion is the basis for the misconveption that the following two propositions stand equally, either both true or false:

1. Pleasure and pain arise conventionally from vitue and nonvirtue.
1. Pleasure and pain arise from a dive creatore and a primal essence.

The two propositions are equivalent to the extent that a line of reasoing that accurately analyzes whether things intrinsically exist will establish neither, but the two are not alike in all respects -- one is contradicted by reason, and the other is not.

We posit forms, sound, and such only as they are known to conventional consciousnesses that are not impaired by internal and external causes of error. Rational analysis of whether they intrinsically exist is irrelavent because we do not assert that these objects can withstand rational analysis. For example, if someone claims "This is a sheep", it is inappropriate to analyze  this claim by asking, "Is it a horse or is it an elephant?" This is similar.
