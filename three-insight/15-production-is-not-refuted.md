# 15. Production is Not Refuted

1. You cannot eradicate conventional phenomena by refuting them through
   investigating whether they are produced in one of the four alternative ways.
1. A refutation of all four parts of the tetralemma is not a legitimate critique
   of conventional phenomena

## A refutation of all four parts of the tetralemma is not a legitimate critique of conventional phenomena   

### Q: Madhyamika texts refute all 4 parts of the tetralemma. 

a thing or intrinsic nature:

1. exists
1. does not exist
1. Both exists and not exists
1. neither existss nor does not exist

Reason refutes everything, as there are no phenomena that are not included among these four!

**Answer:**

'Thing' has 2 meanings. Between these 2 we refute the assertion that things essentially exist in terms of both truths. However at the conventional level we do not refute things that can perform functions.

We say non-compounded phenomena are not intrinsically existant.

So make sure to always add the qualifier `essentially existant`.

If you were to refute the 4 without that qualification it would be contradictory.

**When you refute intrinsic nature of self in regard to the aggregates this gives rise to a wisdom consciousness thinking "The self or intrinsic nature does not exist." If you refute the wisdom consciousness with that view, you are refuting the Madhyamika view.**

This is because you have refuted the object of the wisdom consciousness that knows that phenomena lack intrinsic nature.


### Qualm: There is nothing that is not empty. Therefore, the absence of intrinsic existance also does not exist... in other words: If things lack intrinsic nature, that would refute that the absence of intrinsic nature exists.

That's ridiculous.

`Not empty of intrinsic nature` means having intrinsic nature.

The definite knowledge which apprehends that something such as a seedling lacks
intrinsic nature, apprehends that there is no intrinsic nature. It does not
think `This absence of intrinsic nature` exists, nor does it think `This absence
of instrinsic nature does not exist`.

**This is easy to realize, so don't think in that way.**

**So it is not proper to use reason to refute the existance of emptiness in order to overcome the conception that the absence of intrinsic nature exists**

**There is an awareness apprehending the absence of intrinsic existance, not holding onto emptiness as existing essentially.**

### Q: How could someone develpp an apprehendsion that the absence of intrinsic nature intrinsically exists?

For example, you may develop the idea in the absence of a pot "There is no pot",
thinking "The truth is, there is no pot!"

Since nothing has intrinsic nature, if emptiness had intrinsic nature, then
things would have intrinsic nature.

**If you refute the existance of emptiness which is lack of intrinsic nature, then absence of intrinsic nature would not exist. In that case, since essential or intrinsic nature would exist, it would be totally innapropriate to refute instrinsic existance.**

```
If the absence of instrinsic nature were refuted, then the presence of intrinsic nature would be proven.

Nagarjuna
```

```
The conqueror said that emptiness
Eradicates all dogmatic views:
As for those who take a dogmatic view of emptiness,
He said they are incurable.

Nagarjuna
```

So having dogmatic vies is thinking that emptiness of intrinsic nature itself has true existance, as truly existant, or viewing it as a real thing.

```
If someone says that I have nothing, and that person says, give me that nothing, how could you make that person understand that you have nothing?

Buddhapalita
```

So, emptiness doesnt intrinsically exist, its merely `the absence of intrinsic nature`

If someone says "I have no money", you wouldn't say, "Give me no money!"

So its the same way - "Things dont have intrinsic nature"

The lack of intrinsic nature is not intrinsically existant.

**So you may see in places it says things like**

```
A Bodhisattva who thinks `The aggregates are empty`, is meditating on signs and lacks faith in the realm of production
```

or

```
Therefore the great sage refuted views of self and no-self

Nagarjuna
```

So these say it's wrong to have a view of emptiness or selflessness, you should understand them as explained above. Otherwise they would contradict other great passages like the Heart Sutra

```
A bodhisattva should correctly view the five aggregates as empty of intrinsic existance.
```

In summary:

**The root of all problems is the ignorance that super imposes intrinsic existance. There is only one consciousness that can uproot it by appreending things in a way that totally contradicts it. That consciousness is the wisdom that nows selflessness, the absence of intrinsic existance. So, if you refute this way of apprehending things, you will have to admit that you are refuting the view of reality.**

```
The extinction of attachment is the cause of attaining nirvana. And except for the view of the absence of inherent existance, there is no other teaching that can caue that extinction. So, this is the only door to peace.

Chandrakirti
```

How could you long for an object that is empty?

**Conclusion: There mere negation of intrinsic existance does not refute the object of wisdom, which is the lack of inherent existence.**
