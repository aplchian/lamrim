#Treating the Body Severely
## #174

**The unfulfillment of self-cherishing mind is unbearable**

The more this body is cherished and cosseted(protected in an over indulgent way), protected, and pampered with sweet food, warm clothes, etc... to that very degree it becomes more sensitive. We become irritable and feel that nothing is as it should be, and great suffering is the outcome.

## #175

**Desire is like a mirage ... like a person in a desert who thinks he sees water in the distance, but gets there and there is none.**

We may think that there is nothing wrong satisfying our wants if we have the means to do so, but the fact is that the earth and everything it contains.. wealth, possessions, amusements, etc.. are powerless to satisfy those who have fallen into this state of querulous(complaining in a whining manner) and exageratted sensitivity.  Who can provide them all they crave?  With this type of mind you can't be satisfied. 

## #176

**With desire you can't have equanimity.**

*If you want to be restful, the solution is to be restful and to be content with what you have.

Such people crave beyond hope and suffer the misery of exaustion or of the afflictions of desire and aversion... their minds become filled with evil schemes.  By contrast holy beings have free untrammeled hearts, neither hoping nor craving for the delights of the senses, of friends, and possessions.  For them, there is no end of perfect bliss.

## #177

**There are different levels to this. The lowest level is that desire is an afflicted emotion which causes suffering.  The next is understanding the nature of the body itself. The body comes from contaminated karma.  The deepest level is how identifying yourself with the body is delusional.**

**Trying to fulfill the needs of the body you feel enslaved.  You aren't the body, so you can't feel contentment. So the craving on this basis is delusional.**

**The objective of the body should be for others, not for ME, but now it's the other way around.**

**Whenever you think of the future, you always think of the past, since it is the other side of the same coin.**

```
Of every kind of wealth, contentment is supreme:
This the teacher of both gods and humankind has taught.
Therefore be content. If so you are,
You may have nothing but are rich indeed.

-Suhrillekha
```

Contentment is the wealth of all the Aryas

## #178

But even if we are not attached to our possessions, why should we not cherish our bodies?  The fact is that we nuture and protect our bodies, but in the end it turns to rotting flesh or ashes. And even now while we are alive this body is inert, immaterial, and inanimate... it's moved only under the force of the mind and breath. How is it possible that we regard ourselves as this ghastly frightening body that is composed of so many filthy substances.

## #179

Whether it be alive or dead, what possible use to the mind is this unclean and putrid machine? If we fail to use it for the Dharma, what difference is there between it and a clod of earth or a log of wood? -- none at all.  So why does the mind not rid itself of such pretense imagining that "This is me: this is my body"?

## #180

### **The suffering comes when you waver away from the reality and are floating in the illusion, so then attachment and desire comes in which causes mental afflictions which is suffering**

In order to provide for the needs of just his body -- to provide it with food, clothing, etc. has has worked so hard and has exploited living beings.  This pointless from the view of acheiving liberation aswell as created the causes for future suffering of both this and subsequent lives.  To what end is all this attachment to what is near and and aversions for what is not?  **All in the name of something that is like a rotting tree stump**.  Why do you cling to it; why do you protect it so?
