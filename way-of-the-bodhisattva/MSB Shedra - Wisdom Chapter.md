# MSB Shedra - Wisdom Chapter

## Pt. 2 - Talk 4 9-17

Buddhapalita was first Prasangika teacher.

Their absolute truth is free of absolute truth. Things do arise from their causes and conditions. 

The other schools say things arise from their self or from others. The  shoot arises from self and others.

If there is birth from itself: 
 - it would already be born, what’s the point of it being born again?
- It would also be infinite. Born again, and again, and again, etc.  So being born from itself fails when reasoned.

If born from other: 
- the seed and the shoot have to be born together. other meaning you compare one to the other.. the 2 could be comparable. 
- If they are there as #1 and #2 at the same time, there wouldn’t be a causal relation.. they would be there independently of each other.
- if anything can produce anything, then everything could be a cause of everything as well, there wouldn’t be order.

The birth of a shoot cannot come from seed from other than the shoot itself.

The Prangika’s are like good scientist, with no bias. Just to explore to find the true nature of what things are made of.  If you become bias to any school, then you are emotionally attached to that school and its point of view, and you wouldn’t be exploring the truth honestly and earnestly. So, the true scientist are Prasangika’s.

Chandrakirti reestablished the Prasangika view, and spoke very clear what’s the view of the Pransangika. Since then there has not been one single person who has not refuted Chandrakirti. 

Both Shantideva and Chandrakirti take the stand that the realization of the tuttil? is the way to end of the chain of 12 links. It is the true nature of self and phenomena. 

Samsara is self manufactured by karma and kleshas. 

**Ayatanas are the 6 sense basis**

The kleshas come from the thought process. Grasping and fixation are built into the though process. Without something appearing to the thought process, you can’t have a thought. So what appears to the thought process, the image in the thought process; sight, sound, smell, taste, feeling, or concept. etc… all of them are the grasping object… Then the thought process operates on that by fixating on that. **The grasping and fixation in the thought process is what binds the beings to samsara.** 

Thought process are by product of ones conceptual mind. Thinking where there is no reality of a dharma, imputing a reality of a dharma. Where there is no reality of a self, imputing a self. This imputation comes from the conception mind. And this conception mind that imputes the reality of the dharma and self comes from where?.. elaborations.. meaning mind essentially confused

4 Mistaken Conceptions:
1.  what exists, truly exists
2.  what doesn’t exist, doesn’t truly exist
3. something does exist, and then also it does not exist
4. something neither exists or doesn’t exist

the mind gets confused in these 4 ways in relation to the self and phenomena.

The mind gets confused in the relation to the phenomena itself.

Where does this confused mind start? From the ignorance of not seeing the nature the way it is. When you see the nature the way it is, neither existent or not exist, nor both or either, then you have no ways to grasp and fixate and thus have a conception of any reality of the self and phenomena. Then you won’t have ego of self and phenomena, and won’t have the afflictive emotions and the karma and the byproduct of the karma, the 12 links. 

What truly effects the ignorance in the core is the awake state of mind that is free of all elaborations — tutel.

When you don’t have anything to fixate on the fixation subsides, and when it subsides, the true nature, that is free of all elaborations dawns, and in there, there is no process of grasping or fixation. 

There is no reality of the thought process to impute a reality and hold a reality.

**The world in that way is free from elaborations at all times, its not like at that point it becomes free of elaborations. Its free from elaborations at all times, therefore all elaborations are possible. **

**The dependent originated phenomena are free of elaborations. Free of all elaboration is dependent phenomena. They are a union.  They are always union**

In the absolute they are free from conceptual. In the relative they are all illusory, like a dream. 

But its not chaos. There is an order. Rice seed giving rise to rice shoot, not barley shoot. Precise order is found.

If there is a concept to be based upon.. `this is how it is!`, there is going to a `yul` (object) and `yul-gen` (subjective mind), and there will be duality, and the duality won’t be free from thought process and elaboration aspect of the confused mind, and therefore ignorance.

So because of this the Prasangika’s don’t even say that there is a jnana, because saying there is is a statement that there is something, and that could result in the same old problem of a duality of something existing in the ultimate, something to be fixated in the ultimate. **Thus gone beyond completely.. its pointless to talk about whether or not there is or is not jnana**

This is the most important thing in the path, because we want to bring all beings to the state beyond suffering, and to bring the beings to this realization would be the highest accomplishment of the goal. 

A beginners mind is going to be favorable for the prasangika view, because they won’t have a lot of conceited ideas that are generated by their philosophical tenets.

Prasangika’s main / special audience is bright, non-religious , non school affiliated, common folks. It’s reason of reasoning is very much like the great perfection.

### 26. 

The Vaibasheka school says that the eye consciousness comes in contact with the table, the eye organ and the object comes in contact. There is not really much further explanation how it comes in contact.

If you examine more you will see that they could not come in contact because they are both made of atoms and how could atoms that are by definition, not consciousness, not awareness, be able to experience one by other. 

The Sautrantika realizes this cannot be because 2 non conscious atoms cannot have an experience, so they believe that there is an object made of atoms, but that object always remains hidden, one never comes to have a direct experience with that as an experiencer. But, that object has an image, and that image is a consciousness. That image is perceived by the consciousness.. the image is a consciousness and the images perceived by the consciousness. But, the atom itself is never directly perceived by the consciousness. What we perceive as the atom made table is only the image. That image is consciousness. So this is almost kind of chittamatra school being established. 

If the object is there first and then the consciousness comes, by that time the object is gone. This is at the momentary level.

If the consciousness is there before the object, then what is there for the consciousness to apprehend?

If they are there together, then they are there together independently without the relation, or causality.

**So in this way, the asserter and what is asserted cannot be there together.  But, in an illusory nature it’s possible. It’s not only possible, but you have the experience. It’s only possible if the nature is not rigid and transfixed, and has some kind of reality of it’s own that is immutable. It is all free of elaborations, and illusory phenomena that arises.. just like dream, or a magicians display. In this way there is nothing other than just the experience itself. There is not need to reify or non-reify it.. you just have the experience without have to reify or non-reify. It functions well as it does.**

In absolute truth if you reify something, everything becomes difficult to explain. 

Chittamtran school fully rejects the external world, because the Buddha said: `All three worlds are mind of mind`, and their own reasoning.

If you are able to say anything exists in the relative world to exist, it has to be experienced.. otherwise how would you ever confirm it exists. It has to be an experience of the mind, and awareness of the mind. So, you can’t assert a world that is outside of the mind. It appears there is a world outside of the mind, but there is no world outside of the mind.

But how is it that there is a mountain, lakes, earth, forest, etc. From the habit it seems this way. It is a by product of the all ground. The seeds maturing for all this world we experience comes to ripen, and it’s a result of this ripening of the seeds that are sown in the all ground alaya. Just like in the dream, when you fall asleep, the dream appears. It seems like the dream is separate from the dreamer, but they are all made of the same mind. The dreamer and the experience of the dream are the same, and arise from the alaya, what seed is sown.  In this way they reject the external world.

There is not really a problem with this, most of the mahayana and the vajrayana goes with this schools view, but the only problem then is, they assert there is an intrinsic mind. If its intrinsic it can’t be broken down, or have relation to anything. It has to be autonomous, and because of that it can’t function. **This is where the true aspectarian is refuted by the Madhyimaka** 

Because of this, the false aspectarian comes with a little smarter of a reasoning. *What appears as an object is not a mind*. We are not like true aspectarians who believe that it is mind projected out there, because we hear all your arguments and all your sharp reasoning to refute that view. 

Madhyimaka’s asks, if its not mind out there, is it separate from mind? -\> they say `It is not mind, but it is not seperate from mind`

It’s like a floater, not a real mind… something in between. 

2 reasonings are posed to the chittamatrans.

You say mind is real? yes. And you say this object is not real? yes. So then how could they not be separate? If you insist they are not separate, just as the object is not real, the mind has to become unreal. Otherwise, one being unreal, and one being real, how could it be assertable in that way.


### 27.

*Chit: if mind is unreal, how could it work as a perceiver?*

**There are 2 types of non-existent. Non existent as a real absolute nature, and non-existent as a rabbit horn.**

**Just as you yourself say that the object is not real, but serves as an object. Similarly why not subjective mind is unreal, but can serve as subjective mind?.. using your own reasoning.. what’s the problem.. there shouldn’t be any problem. **

*If the mind is like the rabbit horn, how could everything arise from the rabbit horn like mind?*

**When we think if empty space in our mind, we think of voidness. But absolute truth is not voidness. **

**Do you believe samsara is unreal? It must be, because if samsara is real, you cannot get free from samsara. So samsara is unreal, but you say the mind is real. How could samsara be the mind then… one is real and one is unreal.**

### 28.

This is the mistaken view that all realists have in common in relation to Madhyamikas assertion that all things are unreal.

**Non-real does not mean utter nothingness. Unreal things can appear.  Rabbit horn, barren woman daughter, sky flower… even in the conventional these don’t exist. We are not saying phenomena is like that. They do appear, but don’t have intrinsic reality. They are illusory like a dream.  Because it is unreal, it is possible to wake up from it. Samsara becomes overcome able because it has no reality.**

**As a subjective mind, it needs an object. The chittamantra’s view of the mind would be an isolated thing not about relate with anything, because they view the mind as real. There would be no grasping and fixation. So everyone would already be enlightened**

### 29.
**As a subjective mind, it needs an object. The chittamantra’s view of the mind would be an isolated thing not about relate with anything, because they view the mind as real. There would be no grasping and fixation. So everyone would already be enlightened**

This is a sharp argument to the Chittamatrans

The Chittamatrins say that when *emptiness of subject and object* is actualized, ultimate reality manifests.  So this must mean that all beings are Buddha’s from the very beginning. 

**Functionality of anything depends on unrealness. Emptiness by nature, that allows the functionality by the conditions. Therefore things can arise and dissolve. You could be in bondage due to the conditions, and be free from the dissolution of the conditions. If you assert any reality you are going to run into problems**

### 30.

Even if you see things being illusory, as a scientist does it reduce any attachment to your objective world which you see as lacking inherent existence, and you see it as illusory? 

*Magicians produce beautiful woman due to his power of chemical mixture, mantra power, mind power… nonetheless the magicians has any less attachment than others. So how does knowing things to be illusory help the magician? It doesn’t seem to help very much?*

### 31.

**Him experience of his skhandas being real goes back countless lifetimes. Such habit is still in the magicians mindstream.  Therefore, even though he knows how to create magic and a beautiful woman as an illusory. Nonetheless, his habit of clinging to his own skhandas and the world, doesn’t change a bit. It remains the same. So that is why he still behaves and acts like everyone else in the village. But however, because he knows what he has created is illusory, he doesn’t plan to sleep with the woman he created. So there is some effector knowing that it is illusory.**

The root of craving is the thought process. Craving is the afflictive emotions. Sensory consciousness is not binding you. It is in the thought process that we find grasping and fixation. Tilopa said to Naropa - *Son, appearance does not bind you. It is the grasping and fixation that binds you, so thats what you must cut.*  So how does the thought process get generated? It’s generates from conception.  Thought process is based on conceptual mind conceiving things to be existent and non-existent as real.  

The realization of emptiness is the realization of all elaborations. Absolute truth being not existent, not non-existent. Not both not-neither. It immediately works on its opponent misconception. The wisdom works against the misconception. 

Because existence has been refuted, therefore non-existence is too, because if there is no existence, there is no non-existence. 


### 32.

There will be no grasping to an object that is imputed by ones own mind, with the 4 ways of grasping. One will thus eliminate the process of all elaboration that takes place from ones own mind with the conceptual imputations. At that point, mind comes to be at deep shamata state. At that deep shamata state, the deep visashyana state of reality as it , with nothing to be affirmed or negated, and nothing to be realized.  To have a deep awakening and to know one is free from grasping and fixations. The prajnaparamita that is beyond concepts, unborn like space, dawns. From that point, in the hindsight, you realize how you have been in the prison of the conceptual mind. You never came close to realization of the true nature although it has always been with you. 

As you are seeing the truth as it is. Just seeing it. There is no chance for ignorance to co-exist with that. Due to the power of the habit, we act in an unconscious way. 

In the path of seeing you find the view. And in the path of meditation you familiarize yourself with that and overcome the habit, and obscurations that sort of lingers. First you remove the emotional obscurations and some cognitive, then you purify the cognitive obscurations. At the end of the 10th bhumi you have purified the cognitive and emotional obscurations together. 

**First it is good to resolve all of your questions with the contemplations. Then once you have the understanding it is important to rest and let it be. There is no work to be done. The realization is just seeing what is with no grasping or fixation, after they have subsided. The nature only dawns because you are not fidgeting with it.**

## Pt. 2 - Talk 5 9-17

### 33.
90% of you habit is holding onto things as real. So it works against that.

We hold onto life as real, so then we fear death. If you understand that life is illusory you wouldn’t fear death because you wouldn’t see death as the destruction of life. You relate to it as illusory.

All of our experiences of suffering are from the point of the Madhyamikas, since in the dream, you are asleep.. the loss of the child you will feel it, when you wake up, when the child wasn’t born in the first place there won’t be a loss. In this way, when one wakes up from the duality and holding onto things as real, there is no pain to be felt, because pain is the byproduct of the ignorance. 


### 34.

In the absolute, since you have not found existence, you haven’t found non-existent. From the non duality state you can’t say *there isn’t*.  The nature as it is, is self-illuminating and free of mental construct. 

```
`The Buddhas say that voidness
Is the banishment of all assertion;
Those who ‘have a view’ of voidness,
Are barred, they say, from its accomplishment

Nagarjuna
```
`
### 35.
*How does the Buddha benefit, if all duality has been exhausted? The concept of endeavoring for the sake of others cannot occur*

The Buddhahood brings benefit through the effort the buddha has applied and the strong aspiration and dedication of merit on behalf of the beings. 

Everything is not linear, so its a mystery how everything works. Cause and effect is all magical. That is how it works. Observable, but not explainable. 

There is no concept of endeavor, yet the activity occurs for the welfare of beings.

If Buddha is to be with the intention/conception .. it becomes less reliable for the buddha to be of benefit in this profound way, because then it asserts a self. Self is less reliable, than the nature itself working.

### 36.
Chandrakirti has the example of the potters wheel.

The question is, does it need a constant application of effort.

### 37.

### 38.
If the Buddha doesn’t have a conceptual mind, the buddha becomes inanimate, how could offering produce merit. If to an inanimate object like a stupa, you could accumulate merit, because it is holy. It has the power to accumulate merit. Karma is very subtle.

Like for example how the medicine works on your illness. For the patient is ignorant how it works. 

### 39.

## Proofs of the Supremacy of the Mahayana

### 40.
A true shravaka path must have a view of some emptiness. Without this, egolessness of the self will be difficult to obtain. 

`Parchay may lam` - When the understanding is fighting the illness, like when the the antibodies are fighting the illness. You apply the realization has an antidote to the illness. - the stage of contact

`nam dro lam` - when antidote has won - the stage of victory

this is the`drupa`  - practice

The madhyamikas are saying that you can’t have a deep understanding of the 4 noble truths without the understanding of emptiness. For ex. the self is based on the skhandas,so when you see the emptiness of the skhandas, the selflessness is realized. As long as you cling to the skhandas you are going to have a sense of self. 

There is some disagreement here on the level of realizations that the shravakas need to have, but they all agree that there needs to be some realization of the emptiness of the skhandas for the shravakas.

Je Rinpoche says all for areas realize tutel.  Mipham says that they realize the gross to be empty, but not the subtle, but somehow it serves the base to realize the egoless of the self. 

### 41.

But the shravakas don’t accept the scriptures just sited. They reject the scriptural authority of the Mahayana.

They do this by asking first “How do you establish your scriptures as the Buddha’s words?”

The Mahayana agrees that all Shravakas teaching are buddhas teachings. But for the moment, they challenge them. 

### 42.

So they give 4 reasons here that they think will verify the authenticity of the hinayana teachings. The Mahayana says that yes this is true. But we also have the same reasons!

If by 2 parties agree on something that makes it true.. that would mean even non-buddhist doctrines are true.

### 43.

### 44.
It is going to be hard for shravakas to achieve such a high status because as they themselves admit that they do not have a deep understanding of emptiness. 

The Shravakas are in perfect agreement about the need to realize no-self, but they do not consider non-self and emptiness to be the same.

We cling to the self based on skhandas, and we cling to the skhandas based on parts. When we know that there is not parts, we know there is no skandas, and we know when there is not skhandas there is no parts.
