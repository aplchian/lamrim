The Wise, craves neither possession nor position. It's from such craving that fear and anguish arive in this and future lives. And, all that people wish for.. weath, honor, etc is impermanent and will quickly fade to nothing. We should fix this truth in our mind.. nothing is stable and abiding.

## 22.

We should give up any desire to be on pleasant terms with the world --  we should abandon our fixation on the 8 worldly concerns and our desire for the company of childish beings.  Even buddha could not satisfy everyone.. how could we?  We should leave human companionship behind and remain in solitude.

## 24.

What's the reason for avoiding the company of childish beings? Unless they have their way in everything they are not happpy. Shantideva tells us to shy away from making friends with such people who are interested solely in their own advantage. The Buddha said that no happiness will come to you in the company of such people.

## Once one has relinquished all attachments, one should rely on the excellent qualities of solitude.

## 25.
We as practioners should aspire to live in solitary okaces away from the societ of human beings, in the mountains or in pleasant forests.

## 26.

When will we be free from the backward glances and second thoughts about the future? When will we also be free from anticipation and the making of plans for more than a day ahead, or else a month, or at worst a year without attachment for our dwelling place, our bodies, or our possessions.

## 27. 

Where we can wander and remain at will, being released from all dependency, free from all sense of ownership and consequent attachment.

##28.

Live with few possessions of no value, living without the need to hide either ourselves or our belongings for fear of theives or predators, unafraid of being seen or harmed?

## 29. 

When we look at corpses rotting, we should reflect that just to they were once owned and cherished, and that like our bodies now, they were unable to bear with heat, cold, and disease. We should see how the corpses are like our own bodies; they are exactly the same type of thing. We should remember that however alive they seem now, however much we cherish them, and however sensitive they are, out bodies are at no time different than the corpses we see. We should recall that our bodies are just the same as the corpses... and become accustom to this idea. 

## 30.

We should reflect on the fact that this body of ours will soon be rotting.. but right now it seems so alive. It will give out a stench that jackels and wolves wont want. This is our bodies destiny and it will be there very soon.

## 31. 

This body that has come from our mothers womb.. that seems to whole and integral .. The flesh and bone that life has knit apart will soon fall apart.  When we die it will disentegrate.
