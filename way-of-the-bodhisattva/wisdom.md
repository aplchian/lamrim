# Wisdom

## 1. 

We have to transform / eliminate the ignorance into wisdom so that we can exit cyclic existence.

Branches / Doctrines are the 3 higher disciplines:

1. vinaya: discipline
2. sutra: concentration
3. abhidharma: prajna/wisdom

These 3 are giving us the base to understand reality.

The reason he taught these was to prepare us to understand emptiness.

Unless we have this wisdom we can't be liberated from samsara. 

-- 

The previous 5 perfections were taught for the sake of our auxiliaries to, to the attainment of wisdom. This wisdom is the principal aspect of the extraordinary path and is the direct cause of omniscience; it removes the 2 types of obscurations and actualizes ultimate primordial wisdom endowed with 2fold knowledge. 

```
The Paramitas, when seized with wisdom with lead to to omniscience.
```

```
Blind from birth, without a guide,
The teeming multitudes know not which path to take.
How can they reach the town?
When wisdom is not there, the 5 perfections are deprived of sight.
Unguided, they are powerless to reach enlightenment.
Yet, when they are caught up and seized by wisdom,
They gain their sight and thus assume their name.

In order to attain the perfection of wisdom, which is the fruit, it is necessary to hear and reflect correctly up on the prajnaparamita texts. The experience must be gained in the supreme method, the Prajnaparamita path, in such a way that wisdom and skillful means are never separated.

So therefore, all those wish to have the complete end of all sufferings of existence, both for themselves and others, must diligently cultivate the wisdom that realizes suchness.

```
The mind of yogis
Used to emptiness
Are turned with ease and joy
Toward the benefit of others

- Nagarjuna 'Bodhichittavivarana'
```

This text^ also speaks of "emptiness with the essence of compassion", referring to the fact that, as the Buddha's and Bodhisattvas have proclaimed, the realization of emptiness occurs simultaneously with the birth of compassion. Out of compassion, emptiness is taught to others, so that all the suffering of oneself and others may be brought to nothing.

## 2. 

The conventional and absolute are of one essence.

We may have an understanding of emptiness, but we wouldn't be able to grasp the understanding if we don't have a deep concentration without conceptual mind.

This is why meditation is so crucial. You remain so alert that when conceptual mind comes up, you don't get dragged away. The conceptual understanding wouldn't liberate us.

All phenomena of path samsara and nirvana, have two modes. There is the 'appearing mode', the mere appearance of things. This is the **relative truth**. Then there is 'abiding mode', the way these things really are, their emptiness. This is the 'ultimate truth'.

These 2 are, on their respective levels are indisputable, and thus are regarded as the **2 truths**. 

Its incorrect to say that they are distinct on the ultimate level or that they are one and the same on the relative level. It is said in the Sandhinirmochanasutra that these 2 truths should be understood as neither identical, nor distinct.

The way of beings of things, their ultimate truth - is free from the extremes of both existence and non-existence -- it is not the object of ordinary mind. The intellect that thinks things do exist and do not exist and the language that speaks in these terms are said to be 'relative' and not ultimate. Ultimate truth transcends the ordinary mind, and cannot be expressed in though or word. By contrast, the relative truth is defined as the deluded mind and its object.

From the view of the ultimate, the 2 are not cut off and separate from each other. "form is emptiness, emptiness is form. emptiness is no other than form, and form is no other than emptiness." 

The **Dharmadhatu** is the appearance of union and emptiness and is beyond the extremes of misconception. It is inexpressible in thought and word, It is mind-transcending primordial wisdom,  self-cognizing awareness. It is the perfection of wisdom, the actual ultimate truth in itself. 

On the other hand, whatever the ordinary mind conceives and whatever languages expresses; all such things, which thus become an object of thought and word, if examined are found to be non-existant. They are empty, like mirages and it is never possible for them to withstand analysis.

When it says the dharmata (or ultimate nature) is not an object of knowledge, this means that since the dharmata transcends all conceptual constructs, it is **not conceivable**. 

How could something that is neither subject nor object and is totally devoid of characteristics be properly called an object of knowledge?

```
people say, 'i see space'
they certainly express themselves in words like these.
But how could space be seen? Examine what this means.
In such a way, the Buddha spoke of 'seeing' the Dharmata.
No other image can express such a vision.
```

But though this is the case, when speaking in ordinary terms of how Aryas rest in meditation it is quite alright to to speak in terms of subject and object, and to consider the Dharmadhatu as an object of knowledge.

```
Muchness is unborn, and mind itself is also free from birth;
And when the mind is tuned to this, it is as though it knows the ultimate reality.
For since you say that consciousness cognizes when it takes the aspect of a thing,
It's right for us to speak in such a way.

-Madyamakavatara
```


Saying that the ultimate truth is an object of knowledge in this view is from the standpoint of exclusion. This does not conflict with the earlier contention that the ultimate truth is not an object of knowledge -- and assertion made from the standpoint of detection (amounts to asserting that emptiness is a truly existent thing).

## 3. 

There are 2 types of perceivers:

1. ordinary level
2. one who has meditative mind

The second persons understanding is greater than the first.

## 4.

As well as the 4 tenets, the higher is are greater than the lower.

Within the levels of these 2 persons, there are different levels. The higher scope yogis would be more profound than the lower scope yogis.

In proportion  as their insight into the nature of things becomes more acute, those equipped with valid cognition are able to refute inferior theories and not otherwise. In just the same way, as realization increases on the 5 paths and 10 grounds, and their qualities are acquired, lower realizations and qualities are superseded.

So how do Buddhist disprove the views of ordinary people? By using examples that they both accept. This example is that of mirages and dreams, which though they appear are not truly existent in the way they seem. By contrast there is no example that could be used to show that something appears and truly exists. For this reason, world people can never prove to buddhist practitioners that phenomena truly exist. 

So why even follow the path if everything is like a mirage. It is like trying to wake someone up who is suffering due to dreams. Though illusory, the appearances of samsara and nirvana are inescapable. 


## 5.

When ordinary beings see a thing, they take it to be an absolute love, they wouldn't take it as an illusion. The ordinary being perceives the phenomena as an extreme existent. 

-- 

The point at issue is that, when ordinary people perceive objects, they believe that they exist in just the way that they appear: perfectly real, and absolutely existent. They do not have the insight of Buddhist yogis, who understand that through objects appear, they are like mirages and do not exist truly. This is the point on with they disagree.
