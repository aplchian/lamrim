# Refuge

## The causes for going for refuge

In brief, the causes for going for refuge are twofold: 

1. your fear of the miserable realms and the like
2. conviction that the three jewels can protect you from them

You must strive to realize these 2 causes, because if they remain just words, so will your refuge, but if they are strong and stable, your refuge will transform your mind.

## Based on that, the objects to which you go for refuge.

#### a. Identifying the objects for which you go to refuge

> The one in whom no fault  
> Can ever exist,  
> The one in whom all good qualities  
> Always exist --  

> If you are sensible,  
> It is correct to go for refuge to such a person,  
> To praise and honor him,  
> And abide in his teachings.  

So, if you can distinguish what is a refuge from what is not a refuge, it is right to go for refuge to the Bhagavan Buddha, the true refuge. The same applies to the Dharma, and Sangha.

#### b. The reason why they are worthy of refuge.

There are 4 reasons why the Buddha is worthy of refuge

1. **He has mastered himself and has attained the sublime state of fearlessness.** If he had not attained this, he would not be able to protect others from fear, just as a person who has fallen can not help someone else who has fallen down. 
2. **He is in all ways skilled in the means of training disciples.** If he were not so, he would not be able to fulfill your needs, even if you went to him for refuge.
3. **He has great compassion.** If he did not have it, he would not protect you even if you went to him for refuge.
4. **He is pleased not by material offerings, but by offerings of practice.** If he were not, he would not act as a refuge for everyone, but would help only those who had previously helped him.

Only one who has these 4 qualities is worthy of being a refuge. Since only the Buddha has these qualities, he alone is the refuge. Therefore, his teaching and the community of his disciples are also worthy of being a refuge.

Thus, after you have ascertained these, entrust yourself to the 3 jewels with a single-pointed focus. 

Develop this certainty from the depths of your heart, for, once you are able to do this, they cannot fail to protect you. This is because there are 2 causes of your being protected... an internal and external. The teacher has already fully realized the external factor or cause, **but you suffer because you have not yet developed the internal factor, entrusting yourself to the refuge.**

Therefore, know that the Buddha moved by his great compassion, assists you even if you do not request his help; that he is not lazy at this; and that he, the unrivaled and auspicious refuge, abides as your personal protector. Recognizing this, go for him for refuge.
