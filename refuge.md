# Refuge

## The causes for going for refuge

In brief, the causes for going for refuge are twofold: 

1. your fear of the miserable realms and the like
2. conviction that the three jewels can protect you from them

You must strive to realize these 2 causes, because if they remain just words, so will your refuge, but if they are strong and stable, your refuge will transform your mind.

## Based on that, the objects to which you go for refuge.

#### a. Identifying the objects for which you go to refuge

> The one in whom no fault  
> Can ever exist,  
> The one in whom all good qualities  
> Always exist --  

> If you are sensible,  
> It is correct to go for refuge to such a person,  
> To praise and honor him,  
> And abide in his teachings.  

So, if you can distinguish what is a refuge from what is not a refuge, it is right to go for refuge to the Bhagavan Buddha, the true refuge. The same applies to the Dharma, and Sangha.

#### b. The reason why they are worthy of refuge.

There are 4 reasons why the Buddha is worthy of refuge

1. **He has mastered himself and has attained the sublime state of fearlessness.** If he had not attained this, he would not be able to protect others from fear, just as a person who has fallen can not help someone else who has fallen down. 
2. **He is in all ways skilled in the means of training disciples.** If he were not so, he would not be able to fulfill your needs, even if you went to him for refuge.
3. **He has great compassion.** If he did not have it, he would not protect you even if you went to him for refuge.
4. **He is pleased not by material offerings, but by offerings of practice.** If he were not, he would not act as a refuge for everyone, but would help only those who had previously helped him.

Only one who has these 4 qualities is worthy of being a refuge. Since only the Buddha has these qualities, he alone is the refuge. Therefore, his teaching and the community of his disciples are also worthy of being a refuge.

Thus, after you have ascertained these, entrust yourself to the 3 jewels with a single-pointed focus. 

Develop this certainty from the depths of your heart, for, once you are able to do this, they cannot fail to protect you. This is because there are 2 causes of your being protected... an internal and external. The teacher has already fully realized the external factor or cause, **but you suffer because you have not yet developed the internal factor, entrusting yourself to the refuge.**

Therefore, know that the Buddha moved by his great compassion, assists you even if you do not request his help; that he is not lazy at this; and that he, the unrivaled and auspicious refuge, abides as your personal protector. Recognizing this, go for him for refuge.



## The way you go for refuge

There are 4 aspects to going for refuge:
1. By knowing the good qualities
2. By knowing the distinctions
3. Through commitment
4. By refusing to acknowledge other refuges

#### Going for refuge by knowing the good qualities

Going for refuge in this way requires recalling the good qualities of the refuge... there are 3 subdivisions

1. good qualities of the Buddha
2. good qualities of the Dharma
3. good qualities of the Sangha

##### Good qualities of the Buddha

There are 4 parts:

Good qualities of the Buddhas body, mind, speech, and enlightened activities.

**The good qualities of the Buddha's Body**:
This entails recollection of the Buddha's auspicious signs and exemplary features. Recall them as they are taught in `Praise by Example`

```
You body, adorned with the signs, 
Is beautiful, and elixir for the eye;
It's like a cloudless autumn sky
Decorated with clusters of stars.

O golden Sage,
Beautifully draped with religious robes--
You are like a golden mountain peak
Wrapped in the clouds of sunrise and sunset.

O protector, even the full moon
Free of clouds cannot compare
With the radiant orb of your face
Free of the embellishment of jewelry.

Should a bee see
The lotus of your face
And a lotus opened by the sun, 
It would wonder which was the real lotus

Your white teeth beautify
Your golden face
Like pure moonbeams in autumn pouring through
The gaps between golden mountains.

O one so worthy of worship, your right hand,
Adorned with the sign of the wheel,
Makes the gesture of relief
To people terrified by cyclic existence.

O sage, when you walk, 
Your feet leave marks on this earth
Like splendid lotuses--
How can it be beautified by lotus gardens?
```

**The good qualities of the Buddha's Speech**:

Reflect on the marvelous manner of the Buddha's speech. Even if every being in the universe asks him a different question at the same time, he comprehends them all with one instant of his wisdom. Then he answers all the question with a single word, whichh all beings understand in their own language.

```
Your face is so captivating;
Listening to your pleasant speech 
Is like seeing nectar
Flow from the moon.

Your speech, like a rain cloud,
Settles the dust of attachment;
Like a garuda,
It expels the snake of hostility.

Again and again it is like a sun
Dispelling the darkness of ignorance.
Since it razes the mountain of pride,
It is also like a vajra.

Because you see the truth, your speech never misleads;
Since it is faultless, it is correct;
Since it is well composed, it is easy to understand.
You words are well spoken.

At first your speech 
captivates the listeners minds;
Then if they give it thought,
It clears away attachment and delusion.

It relieves the destitute,
Protects the unruly,
And induces the reveler to renounce--
Your speech accords with everyones needs

It delights the learned,
It improves the minds of the middling, 
And dispels the darkness of the lowly--
This speech is medicine for all beings

**The good qualities of the Buddha's Mind**:

These are explained in terms of the good qualities of knowledge and good qualities of caring

a. **Good qualities of the buddha's knowledge** - Without obstruction, the Buddha's knowledge contacts the real nature and diversity of all phenomena. The Sages knowledge comprehends all phenomena , whereas others limited knowledge cannot comprehend the vast objects that are to be known. You should reflect on this knowledge as it is described here:

```
Only you sublime wisdom 
Comprehends all objects of knowledge;
For everyone other than you
There are objects yet to be known

and also:

O Bhagavan, the entire origination
Of all types of phenomena throughout time
Is within the range of your mind,
Like an amabalan fruit in the palm of your hand.

Like the wind moving across the sky,
Your mind is unimpeded
With respect to the single and manifold
Animate and inanimate phenomena

- Praise in Honor of One Worthy of Honor
```

b. **The good qualities of caring** - In the same way that beings are bound inescapably by the afflictions, so is the sage bound by great compassion, which thus arises continuously as he beholds the suffering of living beings.

```
The afflictions bind all
These being without exception.
You in order, to release them from the afflictions,
Are eternally bound by compassion.

Should I first make obeisance to you,
Or to the great compassion that causes you
To dwell for so long in cyclic existance
Despite knowing its faults?

-Praise in One Hundred and Fifty Verses
```

```
The supreme sage feels great compassion
When he sees being who's minds
Are constantly obscured by the dark gloom of ignorance,
Locked in the prison of cyclic existance.

-Chapter of the Truth Speaker
```

```
The Conqueror feels great compassion when he sees beings
Who's minds are overwhelmed by attachment,
Who have great craving and always long for sensory objects,
And who have fallen in to the ocean of craving's attachment.

The one possessing the 10 powers feels compassion
Which seeks to dispe all suffering
When he sees the afflictions of beings
Harmed by a multitude of illnesses and miseries.

The Sage's compassion arises constantly;
It is impossible for it not to do so.

The Buddha is free of faults because he is concerned
With the needs of all living beings.

-Chapter of the Truth Speaker
```


**The good qualities of enlightened activities**:

The enlightened activities of the Buddha's body, speech, and mind, being both spontaneous and everlasting, help all living beings. If disciples are open to his guidance, the Sage will give them that which is excellent, and lead them out of trouble. Thus the Buddha's activities are certain to do everything that needs to be done. Reflect on this as follows:

```
You explain the destruction of afflictions,
Reveal the deceitfulness of demons,
Proclaim the terrifying nature of cyclic existence,
And show the way of fearlessness.

O compassionate One, wishing to help,
You act for the sake of living beings.
How could there be something helpful
Which you have not done?

-Praise in One Hundred and Fifty Verses
```

```
What trouble is there away from which 
You cannot lead living beings?
What excellent thing is there
That you cannot bestow on the world?

-Praise in Honor of One Worthy of Honor
```



--

This is a brief summary on how you should reflect on the Buddha. If you reflect in a variety of ways, your faith will arise in a variety of ways. the more you reflect, the stronger and more enduring your faith all become. This same applies to the other 2 jewels.

When you have gained certainty by meditating in this way, you will understand that the scriptures and their commentaries are instructions, in that most of them teach the good qualities of the 3 jewels.

The more you practice these things, the more accustomed your mind will become to them, and the easier it will be to practice what you have initially found difficult to learn.

You will develop the spirit of enlightenment thinking "I, too, should obtain buddhahood, like the Buddha whom I recollect." You will have visions of the Buddha day and night. No matter how much you suffer at the time of death, you will not lose your recollection of the Buddha.

```
I instruct you
And you should understand
Peoples' minds become absorbed in something
To the degree that they reflect on it

Therefor, recollect the Master of Sages as having a conquerer's
Physical posture and sublime wisdom.
If you constantly familiarize yourself with such a recollection, 
Your mind will become absorbed in it--

You will desire the wisdom of a holy being
Whether you walk, sit, stand or recline.
Because you yourself will want to become a supreme conqueror of the world,
You will also make prayers aspiring to enlightenment.

- The king of Concentration Sutra
```


>If you reflect on the buddha's good qualities again and again, you will receive blessings commensurate with the strength of you faith and purity of your mind. Because you have gained certainty about them, you will go for refuge from the depths of your heart and train yourself in the precepts of refuge. Then, everything you do will become a practice of the teachings. 

> -> Bodowa

**Reflect again and again on the good qualities of the Buddha, and strive to attain certainty from the depths of your heart. Once you gain this, your reach the very core of the practice of going for refuge, you will gain certainty with respect to the teaching from which the Buddha arose, and the community that practices the teaching. Without this, there is no practice of going for refuge that transforms your mind, not to mention other paths.**
