# General Characteristics of Karma

At this point you should master the classifications of virtue and non-virtue, as well as their effects. Then, you must make it your practice to properly cast aside non virtuous and take up virtuous actions. If you fail to reflect at length on the 2 types of karma and their effects, and then act properly in accordance with this understanding you will not stop the causes of miserable births.

In order to be protected from the miserable realms at the time when you must experience the effects, you have to restrain the mind from engaging in non virtue at the time when you are creating the causes. This in turn is contingent upon attaining conviction about karma and its effects.

You need to gain conviction about karma in its effects by reflecting on karma in general and in detail.

## Reflecting on Karma in General

In general, the way to reflect on karma and its effects entails 4 points:

1. The certainty of karma
2. The magnification of karma
3. Not experiencing the effects of actions that you did not do
4. The the actions you have done do not perish

### 1. The certainty of karma

All happiness in the sense of feelings of ease -- whether of ordinary or noble beings, including even the slightest pleasures such as the rising of a cool breeze for a hell being -- arises from previously accumulated virtuous karma. It is impossible for happiness to arise from non-virtuous karma.

All sufferings in the sense of painful feelings -- including even the slightest suffering occurring in an arhats midstream - arise from previously accumulated non virtuous karma. It is impossible for suffering to arise from virtuous karma.

```
From non virtues come all sufferings
And likewise, all miserable realms.
From virtues come all happy reams
And the hows in all rebirths.

Happiness and suffering do not occur in the absence of causes. Happiness and suffering in general, come from virtuous and non virtuous karma, and the various particular happinesses and sufferings arise individually, without even the slightest confusion, from various particular instances of these 2 kinds of karma.

Attaining certain knowledge of the definiteness, or non deceptiveness, of karma and its effects is called the correct viewpoint for all Buddhists and is praised as the foundation of all virtue.

### 2. The Magnification of Karma

An effect of immense happiness may arise from even a small virtuous karma.
An effect of immense suffering may arise from even a tiny non virtuous karma. 

Hence, internal karmic causation seems to involve a magnification that is not found in external causation.

Become certain of this through reading the sutras. 

Also, there are those who have lapsed in ethical discipline, rituals, livelihood, and philosophical view. They have not accomplished pure forms of the first three. The Nagas view is straight, but have lapsed in the former 3.

**Therefore, solidify the certainty that even the subtlest of virtuous and non virtuous actions follow you like shadows and produce both great happiness and suffering.  Then, strive to cultivate event the subtlest of virtues and eliminate event the subtlest of infractions.**

```
Just as the shadows of birds who dwell
In the sky move along with them,
Beings are followed by
What right and what wrong they have done.

Just as those with few provisions 
Set out on the road and travel in suffering, 
Living beings who have not cultivated good karma
Travel to the miserable realms.

Just as those who have prepared many provisions
Set out on the road and travel in happiness,
Living beings who have cultivated good karma
Travel to the higher realms.

Do not scorn even the slightest sin,
Thinking that it will do no harm;
It is through the accumulation of drops of water
That a great vessel gradually fills

```
By accustoming themselves to virtuous and non virtuous karma
Humans become habituated to these actions.
Though you may ignore such matters,
In other lives you will experience their effects, like a dream.

Those who do not train in generosity, ethical discipline, and the like
And may have great power or enormous wealth,
But they will not find happiness in future lives.

As for those whose family lineage and such are inferior but who are not attached to sin
And who have qualities such as generosity and ethical discipline,
Their happiness in future lifetimes will grow
As surely as the monsoons of summer fill up the ocean.

Once you become certain that virtuous and non virtuous karma
Give rise to happiness and suffering in lives beyond,
Eliminate sins and make effort at virtuous actions.
You without faith, do as you will.

### 3. Not experiencing the effects of actions that you did not do

If you have not accumulated the karma that is the cause for an experience of happiness or suffering, you will in no way experience the happiness or suffering that is its effect.

Those who enjoy the fruits of innumerable collections amassed by the teacher need not have accumulated all the causes, but they need to accumulate a portion.

### 4. The actions you have done do not perish

```
The Brahmins say that virtue and sin
May transfer to others-- like giving and receiving a gift.
You o Buddha taught that what one has done does not perish
And that one does not meet with the effects of what one has not done

Praise of the Exalted one
```

```
Further, once you have committed an action, you will experience its effect;
And you will not experience the effects of what others have done.

King of Concentration Sutra
```

```
Even in one hundred eons
Karma does no perish
When the circumstances and the time arrive
Beings surely feel its effects
