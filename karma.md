# General Characteristics of Karma

At this point you should master the classifications of virtue and non-virtue, as well as their effects. Then, you must make it your practice to properly cast aside non virtuous and take up virtuous actions. If you fail to reflect at length on the 2 types of karma and their effects, and then act properly in accordance with this understanding you will not stop the causes of miserable births.

In order to be protected from the miserable realms at the time when you must experience the effects, you have to restrain the mind from engaging in non virtue at the time when you are creating the causes. This in turn is contingent upon attaining conviction about karma and its effects.

You need to gain conviction about karma in its effects by reflecting on karma in general and in detail.

## Reflecting on Karma in General

In general, the way to reflect on karma and its effects entails 4 points:

1. The certainty of karma
2. The magnification of karma
3. Not experiencing the effects of actions that you did not do
4. The the actions you have done do not perish

### 1. The certainty of karma

All happiness in the sense of feelings of ease -- whether of ordinary or noble beings, including even the slightest pleasures such as the rising of a cool breeze for a hell being -- arises from previously accumulated virtuous karma. It is impossible for happiness to arise from non-virtuous karma.

All sufferings in the sense of painful feelings -- including even the slightest suffering occurring in an arhats midstream - arise from previously accumulated non virtuous karma. It is impossible for suffering to arise from virtuous karma.

```
From non virtues come all sufferings
And likewise, all miserable realms.
From virtues come all happy reams
And the hows in all rebirths.

The Precious Garland
```

Happiness and suffering do not occur in the absence of causes. Happiness and suffering in general, come from virtuous and non virtuous karma, and the various particular happinesses and sufferings arise individually, without even the slightest confusion, from various particular instances of these 2 kinds of karma.

Attaining certain knowledge of the definiteness, or non deceptiveness, of karma and its effects is called the correct viewpoint for all Buddhists and is praised as the foundation of all virtue.

### 2. The Magnification of Karma

An effect of immense happiness may arise from even a small virtuous karma.
An effect of immense suffering may arise from even a tiny non virtuous karma. 

Hence, internal karmic causation seems to involve a magnification that is not found in external causation.

Become certain of this through reading the sutras. 

Also, there are those who have lapsed in ethical discipline, rituals, livelihood, and philosophical view. They have not accomplished pure forms of the first three. The Nagas view is straight, but have lapsed in the former 3.

**Therefore, solidify the certainty that even the subtlest of virtuous and non virtuous actions follow you like shadows and produce both great happiness and suffering.  Then, strive to cultivate event the subtlest of virtues and eliminate event the subtlest of infractions.**

```
Just as the shadows of birds who dwell
In the sky move along with them,
Beings are followed by
What right and what wrong they have done.

Just as those with few provisions 
Set out on the road and travel in suffering, 
Living beings who have not cultivated good karma
Travel to the miserable realms.

Just as those who have prepared many provisions
Set out on the road and travel in happiness,
Living beings who have cultivated good karma
Travel to the higher realms.

```

```
Do not scorn even the slightest sin,
Thinking that it will do no harm;
It is through the accumulation of drops of water
That a great vessel gradually fills

Collection of Indicative Verses
```
```
By accustoming themselves to virtuous and non virtuous karma
Humans become habituated to these actions.
Though you may ignore such matters,
In other lives you will experience their effects, like a dream.

Those who do not train in generosity, ethical discipline, and the like
And may have great power or enormous wealth,
But they will not find happiness in future lives.

As for those whose family lineage and such are inferior but who are not attached to sin
And who have qualities such as generosity and ethical discipline,
Their happiness in future lifetimes will grow
As surely as the monsoons of summer fill up the ocean.

Once you become certain that virtuous and non virtuous karma
Give rise to happiness and suffering in lives beyond,
Eliminate sins and make effort at virtuous actions.
You without faith, do as you will.

### 3. Not experiencing the effects of actions that you did not do

If you have not accumulated the karma that is the cause for an experience of happiness or suffering, you will in no way experience the happiness or suffering that is its effect.

Those who enjoy the fruits of innumerable collections amassed by the teacher need not have accumulated all the causes, but they need to accumulate a portion.

### 4. The actions you have done do not perish

```
The Brahmins say that virtue and sin
May transfer to others-- like giving and receiving a gift.
You o Buddha taught that what one has done does not perish
And that one does not meet with the effects of what one has not done

Praise of the Exalted one
```

```
Further, once you have committed an action, you will experience its effect;
And you will not experience the effects of what others have done.

King of Concentration Sutra
```

```
Even in one hundred eons
Karma does no perish
When the circumstances and the time arrive
Beings surely feel its effects

```

# The Varieties of Karma

The presentation of the distinctions among the varieties of karma has 2 parts:

1. The principal teaching of the ten paths of action
2. The determination of the effects of actions

## 1. The principal teaching of the ten paths of action

Q: So, now that i understand the general characteristics of karma, what sorts of karma and effects should i initially develop certainty? Which should I adopt, and which should I cast aside?

A: In general, you can conclude that there are 3 ways to engage in good and bad conduct -- physically, verbally, and mentally.

Although not all virtues and non virtues are contained in these 10, he summarized the main points and taught the 10 most coarse/obvious. He taught that the extremely great foundation for a misdeed are the 10 paths or non virtuous action and 10 paths of virtue is the 10 positive actions.

```
Systemizing the most obvious among them,
The Buddha said that the paths of action--
Virtuous and non virtuous-- are ten

-The Treasury of Knowledge
```

```
If you practice the 3 paths of actions--
Guarding your speech, being restrained mentally,
And not committing physical nonvirtues--
You will achieve the path taught by the Sage

- Exegesis of Discipline
```

Knowing the 10 paths of non virtuous actions and their effects, restraining yourself from even being motivated to commit them. Then practicing the actions of virtue in which you body, speech, or mind are not at all mixed with the paths of non virtuous action.

This practice is indispensable as the basis for all three vehicles, as well as for the accomplishment of the 2 aims of beings. Hence, the Buddha repeatedly praised it from many perspectives.

```
These paths of the 10 virtuous actions are the sources of divine human birth, of attaining the practices of learners and those with no more to learn, of the enlightenment of pratyekabuddhas, of all the bodhisattva deeds, and of all the qualities of buddha.

-Quests of the Naga Kings of the Ocean 
```

Repeatedly guard your ethical discipline by maintaining a sense of restraint. There are some who have no restraint even with regard to a single practice of ethical discipline that say 'I am a Mahayana Practitioner'. This is very dishonorable.


## 2. The determination of the effects of actions

There are 3 parts to the determination of the effects of actions:

1. Nonvirtuous actions and their effects
2. Virtuous actions and their effects
3. A presentation of other classifications of Karma

### 1. Nonvirtuous actions and their effects

These are explained in three parts:

1. The actual paths of non virtuous actions
2. Distinctions of weight
3. An exposition of the effects


#### 1. The actual paths of non virtuous actions

**1. Killing**

What is killing? This can be taught in 4 categories --  basis, attitude, performance, and culmination. 

- **basis** - killing a being who is alive
- **attitude** - concerning the 3 aspects of attitude -- perception, motivation, and affliction .. perception has 4 types 2 of which are accurate which are perceiving a living being to be a living being and perceiving a non living being to be a non living being. If I want to kill a person named Tod but accidentally kill Tim, there is no actual sin. So an action of killing required an accurate perception. If the person at the time of killing just wants to kill and doesn't care who, and accurate perception is not necessary. This is the case for any of the 9 non virtuous actions.
- The **affliction** is any of the 3 mental poisons.
- The **motivations** is the desire to kill.
- For the **performance** it makes do difference if they do it themselves or get someone else to do it. The nature of the performance is killing with a weapon, poison, etc.
- The **culmination** is the death of another on account of the performance, either at that point in time, or another point in time.

If the killer dies at the same time or after the victim, There is no actual infraction, since the killer has then assumed another life.

**2. Stealing**

- **basis** - anything owned by another
- **perception, affliction** - same as above
- **motivation** - desire to take take the thing from another person even though he or she has not given it to you
- **performance** - the performer is same as before, the nature is either robbing by force of theft by subterfuge(deceit) -- they are equivalent. Whether people engage in deceit about debts and trusts, or take what is not given by other deceitful means, and whether they act for the sake of their own interests or other interests, or to harm another -- these are all equally considered stealing.
- **culmination** - "moving it to another location", which is just an illustration. in the case of things such as fields you can't move them. In such a case, the culmination is thinking you have acquired it. If  you causes another person to steal, it is enough for them to have that thought.

**3. Sexual Misconduct**

- **base** - There are 4 possible basses of sexual misconduct - (1) a person with which you should not have intercourse (2) inappropriate body parts (3) inappropriate places (4) inappropriate times
- **perception** - it is the same whether the perception is accurate or not accurate
- **affliction** - 3 mental poisons
- **motivation** - desire to copulate
- **culmination** - sexual union of 2 parts


**4. Lying**

- **base** - that seen, that heard, that distinguished, and that cognized, as well as the 4 opposite [that not seen, etc] .. When someone else, the recipient -- comprehends the meaning of the lie
- **perception** - misrepresenting a perception
- **affliction** - 3 mental poisons
- **motivation** - Your desire to misrepresent your perception
- **performance** - indicating something through speaking, not speaking, or through gesture. Even causing others to lie is the same as doing it yourself.
- **culmination** - someone else comprehends it. If no-one hears it, its just the infraction of senseless speech. Divisive speech and offense speech are similar in this respect

**5. Divisive Speech**

- **base** - living beings who are compatible or un compatible
- **perception** - as before
- **affliction** - as before
- **motivation** - the desire of living beings who are compatible to be separated or the desire of living beings who are incompatible to remain so
- **performance** - The expression of subject matter than may either be pleasant or un pleasant, and may either be true or false . You may speak or these for either your or another purpose.
- **culmination** - The others understanding of the words that have been spoken. The end of this is when those who are to be divided understand the divisive words.

**6. Offensive Speech**

- **base** - a living being in whom you can engender hostility
- **perception** - as before
- **affliction** - as before
- **motivation** - the desire to speak in an offensive manner
- **performance** - saying something un pleasant, which many be either true or false about the deficiencies of someones family lineage, body, ethical discipline, or behavior.
- **culmination** - speaking in an offensive manner to that person - the person to whom the speech is spoken must understand it

**7. Senseless Speech**

- **base** - speech about a topic that is not meaningful
- **perception** - you yourself perceive the topic about which you wish to speak and then speak. It does not involve someone else to understand it.
- **affliction** - any of the 3
- **motivation** - the desire to make arbitrary / unconnected remarks
- **performance** - to undertake the speaking of senseless speech
- **culmination** having finished an utterance of senseless speech

has 7 basis: 
1. speaking of fighting, faultfinding, disputes, divisions
2. speech such as transmitting and reciting texts with a mind that delights in the treatises of non buddhists, or in the mantra vehicle of brahmins
3. expressions of helplessness such as wailing
4. speaking of laughter, play, entertainment, and enjoyment
5. talking about news of commotion, such as news of kings, ministers, nations, and thieves
6. speaking like a drunkard or lunatic
7. the talk of one who maintains wrong livelihood.

disjointed, irreligious, and senseless speech is speech that is jumbled, reveals afflictions, or is uttered while laughing, singing, or viewing actors and the like


**8. Covetousness**

- **base** - the wealth or possessions of others
- **perception** - perceiving the basis to be what it is
- **affliction** - any among the 3
- **motivation** - the desire to make the wealth or property your own
- **performance** - striving at the contemplated purpose
- **culmination** - thinking "may it become mine", about wealth and the like ... the determination that it will become yours

for this to be full fledged covetousness 5 qualities are required:

1. having a mind that is exceedingly attached to your own resources
2. having a mind of attachment that wants to accumulate resources
3. having a mind of comprehending or experiencing the good things of others -- their wealth and so forth
4. having an envious mind -- thinking that whatever is another should be ones own
5. having a ming that is overcome, due to covetousness, by shamelessness and an obliviousness about the determination to be free from the faults of covetousness

if any of these 5 are not present, there is no actual covetousness. the Levels of yogic deeds says to apply these 5 to all 10 non virtues

An example of not full-fledges covetousness is thinking things like "O how great would it be if others knew me to have such good qualities as being dispassionate, retiring, persevering, learned, and generous"... etc.



**9. Malice**

- **base** - same as offensive speech
- **perception** - same as offensive speech
- **affliction** - same as offensive speech
- **motivation** - the desire to do such things as strike others, thinking such thoughts as, "How nice would it be if they were killed, bound, or their resources were ruined, either naturally or by another person"
- **performance** - having thought the though
- **culmination** - a determination or decision to do things such as beating

It is complete if the following 5 attitudes are present, and incomplete if they are not

1. an attitude of hostility driven by a reifying apprehension of the characteristics of the causes of harm and the phenomena related to them
2. in impatient attitude by way of not being patient with those doing harm to you
3. a resentful attitude based on repeated improper attention to and mindfulness of the causes of your anger
4. An envious attitude which thinks "How nice would it be if my enemy were beaten or killed"
5. an attitude that is dominated by a lack of shame about your malice and obliviousness about the determination to be free of its faults

Examples of simple malice:

"someone is harming me or has harmed me" and thinking about how to bring harm to whoever is doing or did the harm --- this is malice 

Also, the simple wish that someone else relatives, resources, or virtue, etc might deteriorate in this lifetime, and the wish that someone might go to a miserable realm in a future life time



**10. Wrong Views**

- **base** - existant objects
- **perception** - perceiving to be true the meaning of a mistaken denial of the existence of an existent object
- **affliction** - any of 3 mental poisons
- **motivation** - the desire to deny the existence of an existent object
- **performance** - the initiation of that attitude. There are 4 types of such performances: mistaken denial of causes, effects, activities, and existent entities. **causes** - thinking that right or wrong behavior do not exist, and so forth. **effects** - thinking that the fruitions if these sorts of behavior do not exist **activity** - thinking there are no fathers or mothers, thinking there are no former or future lives, thinking living beings cannot have spontaneous birth. **existent entities** - thinking that arhats and such do not exist
- **culmination** - the certainty that you have denied something. 

A full fledged wrong view is associated with these 5 attitudes:

1. an attitude of confusion due to not knowing objects of knowledge exactly
2. a violent attitude, due to delighting in sins
3. an attitude that continuously operates in the wrong way because of pondering improper teachings
4. an attitude that is impaired because of mistaken denial that things that such things as gifts, religious offerings, burnt offerings, and right behavior do not exist
5. an attitude that is dominated, due to these wrong views, by the shamelessness and obliviousness about the determination to be free of its faults


If these 5 are not present, a wrong view is not full fledged




--

With respect to he 10 non-virtues:

you undertake **killing**, **offensive speech**, and **malice** with any of the 3 mental poisons, but bring them to culmination with hostility.

you undertake **stealing**, **sexual misconduct**, and **covetousness** with any of the three mental poisons, but they come to culmination only with attachment

for **lying**, **divisive speech**, and **senseless speech**, they are undertaking and culminated with any of the 3 mental poisons

You undertake **wrong views** with any of the 3 mental poisons, but you bring it to culmination only with delusion.

#### 2. Distinctions of Weight

The distinctions of weight are explained in 2 parts:

1. the weights of the paths of non virtuous actions
2. the criteria for powerful actions


**the weights of the paths of non virtuous actions**

1. **weighty due to attitude** - those done with intense forms of the 3 mental poisons
2. **weighty due to performance** - killing by torture, frightening them, etc.
3. **weighty due to absence of an antidote** - without vows, feeling ashamed, etc.
4. **weighty due to clinging to the perverse** - that done on reliance of a wrong view -- ex. killing for religious reasons.
5. **weighty due to its basis** - killing large animal, human, fetus, bodhisattva, etc.

Killing done with the opposite of these is light.

The above examples were for killing, but they are the same for others. Stealing a lot, stealing from the poor, etc.

The Levels of Yogic Deeds speaks of 6 ways in which actions are weighty:

1. **conditioning** - actions motivated by intense forms of the mental poisons, or by their absence
2. **habituation** - frequently doing, or becoming used to and deeply involved in either virtuous and non virtuous actions for a long times
3. **nature** - for physical and vocal, the earlier are weighted, and for mental the later are weighted
4. **basis** - actions that help or harm those like the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, etc.
5. **fixation on incomplete factors** - as long as you live you completely take up non virtue and don't take up virtue once.
6. **eradication of unfavorable factors** - having eliminated the group of non virtues, you become free from attachment and cultivate virtue


**discussion of the criteria for powerful actions**
