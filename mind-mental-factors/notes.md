# 11 Virtuous Mental Factors དགེ་བ།

Five divisions of mental factors

1. 5 Omnipresent Mental factors (ཀུན་འགྲོ)
2. 5 object ascertaining mental factors
3. 11 virtuous mental factors
4. 6 root afflictions
5. 20 secondary delusions
6. 4 changeable mental states

### Faith དད་པ།

**Three types of faith**

1. **Clarifying Faith དང་བའི་དད་པ།** - a clear mind engendered by seeing the excellent qualities of those so endowed, such as the three jewels. When this faith is generated, the murkiness of the mind is cleared away, whereupon all excellent qualities of realization become suitable to arise in one's continuum.
2. **Faith of Conviction ཡིད་ཆེས་ཀྱི་དད་པ་** - gaining conviction through contemplating the modes of dependent arising, cause and result, and so forth that are taught by the conqueror
3. **Wishing Faith་ མངོན་འདོད་ཀྱི་དད་པ།** - recognizing the delusions can be eliminated to attain nirvana / enlightenment.. the faith thinking 'I shall definitly attain them' 



Pleasure is in the nature of suffering, because the pleasure is a relief of one some pain.

The function of faith is as a support for aspiration. Aspiration / desire.

This is what will overcome the initial laziness.

**In order to generate aspiration, ones needs to see the excellent qualities(clarifying faith), as well as possess the faith of conviction.** For this reason, faith is praised more than once as the foundation of all virtious qualities in the scriptures and their commentaries. 

Thus, all wholesome qualities are companions of faith. 

> The root of all happiness and goodness is the faith of conviction

### Shame / Self Respect ངོ་ཚ་ཤེས་པ།

>  It is an avoidance of misdeeds on account of oneself. It has the function of acting as a support for effective restraint from misconduct

Thinking "This is not something I should do…".

Could be thinking about the karmic consequence .. this would be harmful to me. Also thinking that what you are going to do is harm others, and thinking that you wouldn't want to be harmed like that.

Avoids misdeeds of evil for reasons of personal conscious. Has the function of restraining harmful conduct of body, speech, and mind. 

**Avoiding a negative action and taking ourself as the reason.**

Another, if if you dont do an action because it is not fit for someone that practices dharma to do so.

### Embarrassment ཁྲེལ་ཡོད་པ།

> It is an avoidance of misdeeds on account of others. 

"If others were to despise me as a result of engaging in misconduct, this would not be fitting."

-  Not dissapointing the gurus,etc. 
- Preventing a lack of faith occuring in others.

An act would cause the dissapointment or suffering of others.

---

**Self respect and consideration for others are the determining factors whereby people in this world are regarded as being noble or not.**

Nagarjuna once said that there are 2 things that protects beings of the world; self respect, and consideration for others.

By nurturing these 2 mental factors, we can keep our mind in a virtuous state

If shame or embarrasement are absent, one will be unable to restrain oneself from any misconduct whatesoever. There will be no way to cease conduct.

## 3 Roots of Virtue

**These 3 are virtuous minds that are like an antidote to their opposite. It's not just an absense of their opposite.**

They act as the antidote to misconduct, because misconduct arises from the 3 poisons, and these are the antidote to the 3 poisons.

The divisions that are instances of these three mental factors are infinite, because, taken extensively, all paths are subsumed within them.

### Detachment མ་ཆགས་པ།

> It is a lack of attachment to cyclic existence and the articles of cyclic existence. It has the function of acting as a support for non-engagement in misconduct.

A knower which is disenchanted and lacks attachment.

When referring to an object with within cyclic existence acts as the actual remedy of attachment towards it.

Like looking at a cookie and then seeing that it wont cause happines.. this stops one from developing attachment towards it.

A mental state that sees things more clearly and acts as an antidote to attachment.

The more we can elimate attachment towards our partners, the more authentic the relationship could be. Love is wanting the other person to be happy. Attachment is wanting ourselves to get pleasure and happiness.

### Non-hatred ཞེ་སྡང་མེད་པ།

> It is a lack of malice towards sentient beings, suffering, and the sources of suffering. It has the action of acting as a support for non-engagement in misconduct.

When referring to one of the 3 specific objects, bears the characteristic nature of loving-kindness which directly overcomes hatred. It prevents hatred and for the increase of love, patience, and acceptence. 

Upon cultivation will eradicate anger and hatred. 

1. someone hurting us
2. the hurt / suffering itself
3. the source of suffering. (thorn, etc)

### Non-ignorance གཏི་མུག་མེད་པ།

> It is a knowledge arisen from fruition, scripture, contemplation or realization, and is a wisdom of individual investigation.

A wisdom of individual investigation that is able to serve as the antidote to ignorance, arising from its cause - being either acquired through birth or arisen through application

has the function of increasing the 4 types of wisdom. 

A clarity and sharpness of mind that dispells the bewilderment about an object.

It itself is not wisdom, but accompanies wisdom. 



— 

If you want to get rid of the afflictions, then these 3 roots of virtue act as the remedy to these states. To develop these, is the very path of buddhist practice. 

**All paths and stages are for the sake of abandoning the three poisons as well as their imprints, and all misconduct definitly arises from one of the three poisons.**

Their function is specified as acting as a "support fo effective restraint from misconduct"

To develop these 3 mental factors is the very heart of buddhist practice. For those who genuinly strive for liberation this is the path whereby to fully overcome the inner enemy.

### Effort བརྩོན་འགྲུས།

The mind that is enthusiastic about virtue is effort. It is the antidote for laziness and a mind that is enthusastic about virtue.

The Lam-Rim explains three types of effort:

1. armor-like
2. gathering of virtuous qualities
3. Enacting the welfare of beings



The Compendium of Knowledge teaches 5 types:

1. Effort of armoring - a mental enthusiam developed prior to engaging in virtue - instilled through a wholesome intention
2. Effort of application - enthusiastic when engaging in action
3. Effort of non-inferiority - not thinking 'How can one such as I do this?'
4. Effort of irreversibility - one cannot be diverted by other circumstances at the same time of engaging in virtuous activities
5. Effort of non-complacency - not being complacent with some trifling virtue

It is of utmost importance to know the following in accordance with the foremost Tsongkhapa from Lam Rim Chenmo

1. the benefits of making effort
2. the disadvantages of not doing so
3. the way in which it stops its discordant class - the laziness of procrastination, the adherence to unwholesome activities, and indolence
4. the way to practice the favorable conditions for effort, the four powers — belief, steadfastness, joy, abandonment

You should understand all of this through the Way of the Bodhisattva and the Lam Rim Chenmo

### Pliancy ཤིན་ཏུ་སྦྱངས་པ།

This is the actual antidote to laziness.

It is a serviceability of body and mind due to severing the continuum of unfavorable states of body and mind. It has the function of eliminating obscurations.

It deposits an imprint so that the mind can be applied, however one wants, to a virtuous object of meditation, and that severs the continuum of unfavorible states of body and mind.

Pliancy is of two types:

1. physical pliancy
2. mental pliancy

### Conscientiousness བག་ཡོད།

It is an awareness that accomplishes virtue within abiding in effort without coming under the influence of afflictions, and it guards the mind against contaminations.

Cherishes the accumulation of what is wholesome and guards the mind against that which gives rise to afflictions.

### Equanimity བཏང་སྙོམ།

MF that without having to exert a great effort to prevent excitement and sinking, does not let the mind be affected by them. A quality ascribed t a state of mind in which detachment, non-hatred, non-bewilderment, and enthusiasm are present.
