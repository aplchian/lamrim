# Precepts of Refuge

Once you have taken refuge, the stages of the precepts:

The Precepts are explained in 2 ways:

1. How they appear in the Compendium of Determinations
2. How the appear in the oral tradition

## How they appear in the Compendium of Determinations

### First set of subdivisions

1. **Rely on excellent persons** - You rely on excellent teachers when you see them as the source of all good qualities. You have already gone to the Buddha for refuge and thereby uphold the teacher of the path as your refuge. The practice that accords with this is actual reliance on the one who teaches the path to you.
2. **Listen to the sublime teachings** and
3. **fix your attention properly on them** - You should listen to whatever is appropriate amon the sutras and the like, teachings which are sublime because the Buddha and the Buddha's disciples explained them. In addition, focus on whatever serves to dispel the afflictions, for you have already gone to the teaching for refuge and you have thus undertaken to actualize both the verbal teachings and the teachings as they are realized. The practice that conforms with this is listening to and fixing your attention properly on the sublime teachings.
4. **cultivate a practice that conforms with the teachings** - you should practice in accord with the teachings on nirvana. When you have gone for refuge, to the sangha you have therefore taken as companions persons who are on the path to nirvana. The practice that accords with this is training in the way of those who are intent upon liberation.


### Second set of subdivisions

1. **Do not excite you sensory faculties** - When the sense faculties draw the inattentive mind to objects, you should view this excitement with regard to the sensory objects as a fault, and withdraw the mind from them.
2. **Take up the precepts correctly** - You should take up the trainings set forth by the Buddha - as many as possible.
3. **Be Compassionate Towards Living Beings** - The Buddha's teaching is distinguished by compassion. Therefore, once you have gone to his teachings for refuge, you should also be compassionate towards living beings and forsake harming them.
4. **Strive to Make Periodic Offerings to the 3 Jewels** - Each day you should make offerings to the 3 jewels.

## How they appear in the Oral Tradition

In the Oral tradition, the precepts are divided into special precepts and general precepts

### Special Precepts

These are explained in terms of proscriptive and prescriptive precepts

#### The Proscriptive Precepts

```
Those who go to the three jewels for refuge
Come closer to the truly virtuous
They never go
To other deities for refuge .

Those who go to the sublime teaching for refuge
Harbor no harmful, murderous thoughts.
Those who go to the community for refuge
Do no associate with non-buddhist philosophers

```

Thus there are 3 prescriptive precepts:
1. Not going to other deities for refuge
2. abandoning harm and malice towards living beings - in thought or deed
3. not befriending non-Buddhist philosophers - not agreeing with those who do note believe in the 3 jewels as refuge and who repudiate them


#### The Prescriptive Precepts

1. **Treat images of the Buddha as objects of reverence** - as though they were the real teacher himself. Not pointing out their faults regardless of their quality, not disrespecting them and treating them with contempt by putting them in dishonorable places, pawning them, etc.
2. **Never show disrespect for writings on the teachings,** even those composed of as little as 4 words. You shouldn't pawn them, place them on the bare ground, carrying them with shoes, walk over them, etc. Treat them with respect as if they were the teaching jewel itself. 
3. Never revile or despise members of the community, renunciates, or those who merely possess the symbols of a practitioner of virtue [someone who dresses like a monk or nun but has no vows]. Never in any way divide yourself and others into opposing factions and view the others as enemies. Always treat members of the community with respect as if they were the community jewel itself. 

```
This dwelling in the forest, desiring good qualities,
Should no scrutinize others' faults.
They should not think,
"I am superior; I am the best"

Such arrogance is the root of all unruliness.
Do not despise inferior monks,
Or you will not achieve liberation for an eon.
Such is the way of this teaching.

-Exhortation to Wholehearted Resolve.
```
For as much as we respect the 3 jewels, so will living beings respect us.

```
You will obtain a result similar
To the kinds of karma you do.
```


### General Precepts

There are 6 general precepts:

1. **By recalling the distinctions and good qualities of the 3 jewels, go for refuge again and again**- as previously explained, you should repeatedly keep in mind the difference between non-buddhist and buddhists, the distinctions among the 3 jewels, and the good qualities of the 3 jewels.
2. **By recalling the kindness of the 3 jewels, strive to worship them constantly and offer the first portion of your food and drink.** - 

```
Though they obtain food due to the buddha's merit,
The childish do not repay their kindness

- The King of Concentrations Sutra
```

Thus, knowing that all temporary goodness and certain goodness that you experience, symbolized by good, are due to the kindness of the 3 jewels, you should make offering with the intention of repaying their kindness. 

With regards to offerings there are:

1. actions of offering
2. the attitudes

#### actions of offering

1. **Offerings to the Buddha's body** means offerings to the actual embodiment as form
2. **Offerings to stupas** - offering to stupas and the like
3. **Offering to a perceived object** - offerings to the above mentioned two as they manifest to your own sensory faculties
4. **Offering to a unperceived object** - offerings made to a Buddha or his stupas that are not actually present, and made for the sake of all buddhas and stupas. When you make an offering to the unperceived buddhas and stupas, you are also making offerings to the perceived objects, for the reality of emptiness of one of them, is the reality of all of them. It is standard to make offerings to perceived and unperceived with the thought "I make offerings to all the Buddhas of the three times and to the stupas of the 10 directions of the limitless universe". Making an offering to a perceived object accumulates mass merit, and unperceived even greater. Making offerings to all the buddhas and stupas accumulates more merit than even that. Thus it is important when you make an offering to a single buddha or his image, you recollect the indivisibility of reality and project the thought that you are making offerings to all of them.
5. **Offerings made yourself** - offerings made manually by yourself. Do not have other make them for you out of your laziness.
6. **Offerings that you help others to make** - offerings that you out of compassion, cause someone else to make. You will both share the merits. 
7. **Offerings of wealth and service** - offerings to a buddha or his stupa consisting of gifts of clothing, food, bedding, seats, medicine, personal necessities, incense, aromatic powders, ointment, flowers, music, various types of lamps. There is also offering of prostrations, rising, hands joined together respectfully, obesiensene with limbs or head touching the ground, clockwise circumambulation. Inexhaustible gifts such as fields can be given, jewelry, bells, silver coins, etc.
8. **Vast Offerings** - Means offering the above over a long duration of time. They have 7 qualities: being copious, excellent, both perceived and non perceived, done by both oneself and others, being offered with heartfelt delight, fervent aspiration, with merit being dedicated towards perfect enlightenment.
9. **Offerings not contaminated with afflictions** - offerings with 6 qualities they are made 1) manually by yourself or not making others do them out of contempt, careless, or laziness 2) respectfully 3) without distraction 4) free of the afflictions in that they are not mixed with attachment and the like 5) without expectation of receiving wealth and service from a king who has faith in the buddha 6) proper material accompaniments(whatever is free of inappropriate things).

* You should delight in all the appropriate offerings to the tathagata that exist through the universe... imagine them to be vast and pervasive, and rejoice in others offering them. 

* Having made this great measureless offering, you will, with little difficulty, amass the accumulations necessary for attaining enlightenment.  Strive constantly to do this with a contended, happy mind.   
10. **10. offerings of practice** - entails recollecting the 4 immeasurables, the fourfold condensations of the teaching [impermanence, suffering, selflessness, nirvana ], three refuges, and the perfections, admiring profound emptiness and fixing it without conceptualizations; discipling your mind through the vows of ethical discipline; meditating on and striving for the factors of enlightenment, the perfections, and the 4 ways of gathering disciples, all for atlas 10 to 15 minutes.


To make these 10 types of offering to the 3 jewels is to make a complete offering.
