# How to Practice

The teachings of what to do during the meditation session and between encompasses everything.

If you divide your life into these 2 periods and practice each according to the teachings, your whole life will become meaningful. Whatever you do throughout the day will become powerful and meaningful.

Since the dharma is like medicine, practice sessions are like taking doses. 

**How long do you remain with each practice before you move on to the next stage of the path?**

You work on each step everyday until you achieve a certain spontaneous mental capability in that practice. When you obtain that level of development you go on to the next stage.



## The Prepatory Practices

A meditation session is composed of three parts:

1. preparation
2. actual meditation
3. conclusion

No matter what topic you actually meditate on, the activities of the preparation and conclusion are essential.


The goal of practice is to attain liberation and buddhahood, to become a bodhisattva.

The 2 causes of this are the the accumulation of merit and wisdom. So all practices should build these 2.

Wisdom that understand the conventional and ultimate nature of reality is like the seed. We need to support this wisdom with the mental strength gained from accumulating merit through virtuous karma. These virtuous activities are just like the additional conditions of moisture, fertile ground, etc., that enable a seed to grow.

**The main point here is that each meditation session needs to include both the accumulation of merit, and the accumulation of wisdom.**

If the collection of merit is strong it is like having good soil where the wisdom can grow and blossom. 

What makes an act positive is the mental state in which it is done. **These 6 predatory practices are special internal practices, not merely physical acts.**

Once you know how to do them, all the different activities you engage in every day, every action, every movement - can become meritorious; even cleaning your house can become a virtuous activity.


### The First Preparation (cleaning, and arranging representations)

**The first part of the first preparation is to clean the place where you meditate.**

You should think that you are cleaning your meditation place because you have invited the special beings to it. With this kind of thought the action becomes virtuous. 

**The point of this part of the first preparation is that you need to keep the place where your practice clean and pure. You should enjoy doing this. With a happy religious attitude, remember that you are not just cleaning up your meditation place for your own pleasure or enjoyment. You should think "It is for the honor of inviting the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas that I am cleaning. By clearing away the physical dust, may my indoor first and stains also be cleansed. With prayers such as this the whole endeavor becomes virtuous activity and you gain merit."**

**The second part of the first preparation is to arrange representation of the buddhas body, speech, and mind in a special high place.**

### The Second Preparation (offerings)

The second predatory practice is to set our a beautiful arrangement of offerings gathered without deceit or cunning.

The point of making the offering is to please the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. It is your virtue that will please them. 

In order to accumulate merit you make offerings in your mind to the buddhas and bodhisattvas and you prepare various substances and arrange them in a special way.

**You offer the things that you enjoy. Since you are living in the desire realm the things you take pleasure in are sensory objects; so you offer the objects of the 5 senses to the buddhas**

**The principle is that what you offer should be pleasing to the buddhas and bodhisattvas.**

Whatever you offer should be obtained properly 

You can offer objects of your five sense faculties and your mental faculty, such as incense, pure water, fruit, and so forth.

The beauty of the arrangement is all part of the offering to the sense faculty of vision.
