### Identifying The Object to Be Negated

In order to know a person is not present, you must know the absent person. Likewise, in order to be certain of the meaning of selflessness, or lack of instrinsic existance, you must carefully identify the self, or intrinsic nature that does not exist.

If you dont have a clear concept of the object to be negated, you will also not have accurate knowledge of its negation. 

It is crucial to identify the object of negation carefully, for if it is not identified accuratley you will certainly develop either a nihilistic or eternalistic view.

You must know the object precisely and negate that. Not more, and not less.

'Production from another does not exist even in the world'

Chandrakirti relates intrinsic existance in terms of both truths.  If something doesn't intrinsically exist, how else could it exist?

*Identifying the distinguishing features of Madhyamaka*

Profound wisdom understands the relationship between conventional cause and effect. Specific effects arise from specific causes.

Amassing the collection of merit and wisdom definitily relies on attaining certain knowledge of the real nature of phenomenon.  This means reaching a profound certainty that all phenomenon lack even a particle of essential or intrinsic existance.

All of the teachings on the four noble truths, cyclic existance, nirvana, etc dont make sense in context of non emptiness, of intrinsic existance, but make sense within the context of emptiness of intrinsic existance.

Nagarjuna holds that one must seek the emptiness of intrinsic existance and the middle way on the very basis of the teachings of cause and effect -- that is the production and cessation of specific effects in dependence on specific causes and conditions.

```
That which arises dependently we explain as emptiness.
This emptiness is dependent designation.
This is the middle way
```

```
Because there is no phenomenon that is not a dependent arising
There is no phenomenon that is not empty

- Nagarjuna
```

Thus the Noble Nagarjuna says that dependent arisings are necessarily empty of intrinsic existance.

The unequaled Tathagata taught that because all things are empty of intrinsic existance, things are dependent arisings.

```
You hold that whatever arises dependently is empty.
There is nothing to match your Roar.
'Things do not exists on their own!'
```

The explanation that dependent-arising is the meaning of emptiness, lacking intrinsic existance, is the unique system of Arya Nagarjuna.

All the dependent arisings of cyclic existance and Nirvana are admissable in a system that teaches the absense of intrinsic existance.
