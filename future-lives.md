# Reflecting on Future Lives

## Contemplating what will occur in your future life: the happiness or suffering of the 2 types of beings.

You will die soon and then be reborn into either a happy realm or a miserable realm, because there is no birthplace but amongst these 2 types.  Since you are under the control of your karma, you cannot choose where you want to be born. Your virtuous / nonvirtuous karma will dictate where you are born. This being the case you should contemplate the lower realms and think about how it would be if you were born there.

Nagarjuna says to meditate on the cold and hot hells, animal realms, and ghost realms daily, and determine to stop the causes of birth there and to create the causes of happiness.

This will make you careful to avoid committing sins and seeing that virtue creates happiness you will delight in virtue.

Frightened by suffering you fervently go for refuge to the 3 jewels.

```
Since without suffering there is no determination to be free,
You, mind, be fixed!

-Shantideva

## Contemplating the suffering of the hell denizens

### Contemplating the suffering of the great hells of living beings

There are 8 great hells.

1. **Reviving Hell** - the first, it lies 32,000 leagues beneath us. The other 7 are situated every 4,000 leagues beneath that. The living beings of this hell assemble and hack each other with carious weapons that appear one by one through the force of karma, until they swoon and fall to the ground. Then a voice from the sky yells 'Revive!' and they rise up again and hack each other as before and experience measureless suffering.
2. **Black Line Hell** - The hell guardians use black lines to mark the bodies of the living beings born there into quarters, eighths, and many other smaller divisions. The beings experience the pain of being split and chopped along these lines of weapons.
3. **Crushing Hell** - The hell guardians herd the hell beings in between 2 iron mountains shaped like goat heads and then squeeze them between the mountains, causing streams of blood to gush from all of their orifices. They are also pressed between sheep-headed, horse-headed, elephant-headed, lion-headed, and tiger-headed mountains. When they are gathered together again they are inserted into a great iron machine and pressed like sugarcane. Then they reassemble on an iron surface where great iron boulders are hurled upon them, cutting, splitting, smashing, and flattening them, again causing torrents of blood to gush forth. 
4. **Howling Hell** - Living beings who search for a home are herded into an iron house and incinerated by blazing fire and conflagration.
5. **Great Howling Hell** - similar to Howling hell, except the beings are inside 2 irons houses, one within another.
6. **Hot Hell** - The hell-guardians throw living beings into a hot, blazing iron kettle many leagues across and boil them, deep frying them like fish. Then they impale through their anuses with blazing iron skewers, which emerge through the crowns of their heads; blazing flames leap forward from their mouths, eyes, noses, ears, and from their pores. They are then placed either on their backs or their stomachs on a blazing hot surface where they are pounded with a blazing hot iron hammer.
7. **Extremely Hot Hells** - Guardians force iron tridents into their victims anuses, the left and right prongs coming out of their shoulders and center prong out the crown of their head causes blazing flames to shoot from their mouths and from other orifices. Their bodies are caught in a blazing hot iron press; they are thrown head-first into a great blazing iron kettle full of boiling water, floating up and down and all around until their skin, flesh, and blood are destroyed and only their skeletal remains. The guardians then fish them out, spread them on the iron surface -- there their skin, flesh and blood regenerate -- and then throw them back into the kettle. The remaining torments are similar to those of the hot hell.
8. **Unrelenting Hell** - the ground blazes for many hundreds of leagues from the east. As this blaze increases, it assumes the force of a conflagration. It then incinerates the skin, flesh, intestines, and bones of the living beings, penetrating all the way to their marrow. The beings entire bodies are engulfed in flames as if they were wicks of butter lamps. The same thing occurs from the other three directions. When the fires combine from all 4 directions, they combine and beings experience uninterrupted suffering. You know them to be living beings only by the piteous wails they emit. On other occasions they are placed into blazing iron embers in an iron winnowing basket, and the basket is shaken violently. On other occasions they are forced to climb up great iron mountains, then fall from them onto an iron surface. On other occasions their tongues are pulled out of their mouths and stretched out with a hundred iron pegs, like ox hides until they have no wrinkles or ridges. At other times they are laid out on their backs on iron surfaces and their mouths are pried open with iron tongs, while blazing lumps of iron and boiling copper are forced in until their mouths, esophagi, and intestines are burned and the residue flows out below. The other torments are like those of the extremely hot hell. 


This is only a rough description, but there are many other sufferings aswell. This is how they are explained in the level of yogic deeds. 

The duration of these is described in the Friendly Letter

```
Even though you experience
Such horrible sufferings for a billion years,
You do not die
Until the nonvirtue is spent.

-Nagarjuna
```
Thus, you must experience these sufferings until the force your karma is exhausted.

```
50 human years
Is a single day for the lower deities
Of the desire realm;
This is doubled for the higher deities
```

```
The life span of the desire realm deities is equal to a day
In the 6 hells, the reviving hell and so forth, in sequence
Thus their life spans
Are similar to those of the desire realm deities.

The life span in the extremely Hot Hell is half of an intermediate eon.
In the unrelenting hell, it is an intermediate eon.
```



### Contemplating the suffering of the adjoining hells

Each of the 8 hot hells has 4 walls and 4 doors and is encircled by an iron fence, which has 4 doors. At each of these doors there are 4 additional hells for living beings:

1. **The Pit of Embers** - contains embers in which the denizens sink up to their knees. When these beings go there in search of a home, they step into it, and their skin, flesh, and blood are completely destroyed, only to regenerate when they lift their feet again
2. **The Swamp of Putrid Corpses or the Swamp of Excrement that Stinks Like a Corpse** - A swamp of excrement that stinks like a corpse, into which living beings seeking a home attempt to cross but fall sinking in over their shoulders. The swamp is inhabited by 'sharp-beaked worms' which pierce the skin, flesh, intestines, and bones, boring down to the marrow.
3. **The Path of Razors and Such** - Where beings seeking a home walk a path filled with razor teeth. With each step, the teeth lacerate their skin, flesh, and blood, but each time they lift their feet, their bodies regenerate. Nearby is the **Sword Leafed Forest**. When beings rest there in the shade, swords fall from the trees, piercing and splitting their limbs, fingers, and toes. When they swoon they are attacked by mongrel dogs who carry them off by the scruff of their necks and eat them. Nearby is **Forest of Iron Silk-cotton Trees**. Being seeking a home come and climb these trees which are covered with thorns that point downwards on the way up and upwards on the way down so that the thorns split and pierce the beings limbs, fingers, and toes. Iron beaked crows sit on their shoulders and heads and pluck out and eat their eyeballs. Since all these places subject their inhabitants to harm by means of weapons, they should be counted as one adjoined hell.
4. **The River With No Ford** - The River with no Ford is filled with boiling water. Living beings seeking a home fall into it and are tossed about and cooked as if they were peas thrown into a pot of water over a great blazing fire. On both banks of this river sit beings armed with clubs, hooks, and nets who keep the tormented from escaping, or drag them out with the hooks and nets and lay them on their back on the great blazing ground demanding to know what they want. When they replay "We do not understand at all and cannot see, but we are hungry and thirsty," they are fed blazing lumps of iron and boiling copper.

The life spans of living beings in the adjoining hells and occasional hells are not fixed, but they must suffer in these places for a long time until the power of their karma for experiencing these sufferings is exhausted.

### Contemplating the Sufferings of the Cold Hells.

Each of the 8 great hells of living beings is 10,000 leagues wide and the 8 great cold hells lie outside of these.

1. **Blistering Hell** - The first cold hell. 32,000 leagues below the earth. The other 7 are situated every 2,000 leagues beneath that. Here the hell beings are blasted by a great wind that shrivels and then raises blisters all over their body.
2. **Popping Blisters Hell** - Similar to the above, except that the blisters pop as the body shrivels.
3. **Chattering Teeth**
4. **Weeping**
5. **Moaning** -- These 3 hells are named after the sound the denizens make
6. **Splitting Water Lily Hell** - The denizens are blasted by a great wind which causes them to turn blue and split into 5 or 6 pieces.
7. **Splitting-like-a-Lotus Hell** - the beings turn from blue to red and split into 10 or more pieces
8. **Great Splitting-like-a-Lotus Hell** - The beings skin becomes very red and splits into 100 or more pieces 


The Garland of Birth Stories says that these hell beings dwell in darkness.

```
An incomparable wind pierces your bones;
Your body shakes and freezes; you bend over and shrivel.
Hundreds of blisters rise and pop.
Creatures born from them eat and claw you; fat, lymph, and marrow ooze out.

Exhausted, teeth-clenched, all hair standing on end,
You are tormented by wounds in your eyes, ears, and gullet.
Mind and body are stupefied by pain.
You dwell in the cold hell and emit a pitiful wail.

-Nagarjuna - Friendly Letter
```

```
Understand that the life span of living beings born in the cold hells is 1 1/2 times as long as that of living beings born in the corresponding great hells of living beings.

Levels of Yogic Deeds
```

```
Imagine filling a vessel full of sesame seeds and throwing one out every 100 years until it is empty. This vessel becomes emptied much sooner than the complete life span of the living beings born in the blistering hell. 20 Life spans of the Blistering Hell make up a single life span in the Popping hell

20 Life spans of the splitting like a lotus equal one life of the great splitting like a lotus.

-Vasubandhu
```

### Contemplating the suffering of the occasional hells

The occasional hells adjoin the hot hells and cold hells, and the Levels of Yogic Deeds say that they exist in the human regions as well.

```
The 16 hells for living beings are created by the force of the karma of all living beings. The occasional hells are created by the individual karma of 1, 2, or many living beings and therefore are of many different types. They have no fixed location since they exist in rivers, mountains, wastelands, below the earth, and other places as well.

-Vasubandhu
```

**Thus, the conditions for being born in any of these hells are very easy to create, and every single day you acquire more of them. Since you have already accumulated innumerable causes in your past, you complacence is inappropriate. Therefore, after reflecting on these hells, be frightened -- nothing separates you from them after the mere cessation of your breath.**

```
Having created the karma for hell,
Why are you complacent like this?

-Shantideva
```

```
Sinners who hear the boundless sufferings in the hells-- 
Separated from them only until the more termination of their breathing -- 
Are not completely terrified,
Have hearts as hard as diamonds.

If you are frightened by seeing paintings of hell, 
By hearing of it, recalling it,
Reading about it and by representations of it,
What needs to mention experiencing the fierce actuality of it.

-Nagarjuna - A Friendly Letter
```

Among the sufferings of cyclic existence, those of the miserable realms are the most difficult to endure. **Among these, the sufferings of the hells are most unbearable, for the pain of being continually pierced by 300 sharp spears for a full day is nothing compared to even the mildest of the hells suffering.** Among these, the Unrelenting Hell is by the greatest.


```
Just as among all kinds of happiness
The cessation of craving is the king of happiness
So among all kinds of suffering
The suffering of the unrelenting Hell is most fierce.

-Nagarjuna - A Friendly Letter
```

Know that the sole cause of such suffering is your physical, verbal, and mental wrongdoing. Strive with whatever human skill you have not to be defiled by even the slightest wrong doing.

```
The seed of these non-virtuous results
Are you physical, verbal, and mental wrongdoing.
Strive with whatever skill you possess
Not to have even a bit of it!

-Nagarjuna
