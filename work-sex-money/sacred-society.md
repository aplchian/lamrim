# Ch. 1 Sacred Society

We have this idealistic view of what spirituality is. We see it as totally divorced from the activities of what we see as mundane "society". We may even want to push away things like work, sex, and money because we think we are spiritual people, and these things don't fit into our idea of what spiritual is.

So why should we even care about them?  Well.. if we look out our life, these things are actually a huge part of our life.. so maybe we should look into them.

Perhaps our view of spiritually isn't quite right... maybe it isn't "spirituality" in an idealized sense. Real spirituality may have something to do with ordinary life. 

So if spiritual does have something to do with everyday life situations, then relating to spirituality means contributing something to society as a whole. **We have to associate with society to offer something to society.**

Right now we think about society in terms of what is demanded of us, what we give.. and what we get out of the situation. **We call this viewpoint materialism**

So, if we look at society through this materialist view, we may think that society doesn't have much to offer us on the spiritual path.

However, from a genuine spiritual point of view, as opposed to an idealized point of view, society is an extremely potent arena. 

Rather than looking at society from an abstract level, we can work with it through the practicality of work, sex, and money. 

So from this point of view, we could see how we could possible contribute something to society... we can see something relevant to us in society. 

**The whole question boils down to whether we regard society as sacred.** Society does contain profundity and sacredness. The sacredness of society is potent and powerful.  So its important to see the spiritual aspect... the visionary aspect of society.  **We have to not only see the basic happening, but also their basic quality of energy. The energy that they contain. This is what we are looking for here.**

We have to look at what is happening. There are flashes of negative energy, flashes of positive energy, flashes of destruction, flashes of hatred and love. 

Can we approach spirituality and our relationship to society from an engaged perspective?

You are in fact apart of society.. just look at the facts.. its easy to see. The main issue is whether you are genuinely open to relating with society as part of your personal journey of spiritualy.


Does society mean anything to you on your path, or do you want to just attain individual liberation and leave society behind? Do you want to abandon all others? Do you care how society suffers who how it may gain bliss?

We could move to the country and just look at the city and laugh like they are our pet guinea pig colony. Your relationship to the city is the same as a scientist relating to their guinea pigs. This is the attitude some people have that are involved in the spiritual scene towards city dwellers.

**This is a very uncompassionate attitude.** We are laughing at other people while not seeing the contradictory and humorous aspect of our own lives. 

If that approach becomes apart of a spiritual view it becomes sickening because it regards average citizens as terrible, as failures to humanity, as embarrassing. This approach comes from preconceived ideas about living in the city and we are not willing to communicate with those preconceptions.


We have preconceptions about work, sex, and money. Just because we find it difficult to relate to these things doesn't mean we should rum away from them. **Because there is something destructive and difficult, there must be something creative involved aswell. Relating to that creative aspect is the point here.**

There is the story of the arhat who finds a bone at a charnel ground and contemplates how it came from death which came from birth, etc. all the way to ignorance in the 12 links. We could work in the same way in our own situation. We don't have to reject or abandon anything. **We could work on the creative aspect of situations.**

The dharma teachings aren't going to be romantic, but could be painful and cause paranoia. But at the same time, we can work with the situation and find something creative in it. We can include all of these things as part of the inspiration. 

We have so many entertainments.. internet, books, friends, etc, etc. We could get tired of this so we could try to entertain ourselves in a spiritual way rather than a gaudy or flashy way.

We don't have to completely eliminate entertainment. The problem is a lack of sense of humor about the whole thing. We are so serious about our entertainment, even comedy. Instead you could entertain yourself with a sense of humor which doesn't have to be cynical. You can enjoy everything as a play. **Whereas if you impose your likes and dislike on everything the situation will become very tiring because you're seriously selecting all the time.**

As practitioners we have to work with the karmic situation of America, to start with. A certain reformation can take place by natural force -- not through carrying placards or staging demonstrations. But it won't happen in an easy or luxurious way. We don't know what the reformation will look like. We have to work with our own inspiration.

You may try to get away from society, but you will still have to deal with society somehow.. like getting your food, etc.

However, you may find it necessary to separate from society at large at times to gain perspective. Without a comparative POV to see society from there is no working basis. When you step back you gain perspective. However working with society is essential to gain that perspective as well. **So the process of stepping back and then reneging should be alternate or be joined side by side -- like the idea of wisdom and compassion being side by side. Meditation can provide that non dual perspective.**


Once a person is involved in meditation and working on the spiritual path, then the problems with engaging with society are not hangups, but creative opportunities. The everyday situations become part of you meditation practice. 

We have to work on our own attitude to develop an attitude of openness. We can't think we are going to do this and that and the city will reform to our wishes. We have to relate with a much bigger world that includes everyone. 

We don't work to undermine the culture, but the culture provides us a focal point to relate with... so we work with them. We may have inaccurate views of situations, but this doesn't matter. If you work along with situations, things become clear. The initial evaluation doesn't have to be the ultimate landmark. 

The more you involve yourself with society, the more experiences you have, the more workable situations will become. The intensity of your engagement bring space. When you involve yourself with situations such as overpopulation and the overpowering experience of being in the city, your involvement acts as a guardian. It helps others. It protects them, because you refuse to abandon them. You find inspiration within work, sex, and money. Within those things, you can find a connection to the sacredness of society.
