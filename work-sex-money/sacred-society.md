# Ch. 1 Sacred Society

We have this idealistic view of what spirituality is. We see it as totally divorced from the activities of what we see as mundane "society". We may even want to push away things like work, sex, and money because we think we are spiritual people, and these things don't fit into our idea of what spiritual is.

So why should we even care about them?  Well.. if we look out our life, these things are actually a huge part of our life.. so maybe we should look into them.

Perhaps our view of spiritually isn't quite right... maybe it isn't "spirituality" in an idealized sense. Real spirituality may have something to do with ordinary life. 

So if spiritual does have something to do with everyday life situations, then relating to spirituality means contributing something to society as a whole. **We have to associate with society to offer something to society.**

Right now we think about society in terms of what is demanded of us, what we give.. and what we get out of the situation. **We call this viewpoint materialism**

So, if we look at society through this materialist view, we may think that society doesn't have much to offer us on the spiritual path.

However, from a genuine spiritual point of view, as opposed to an idealized point of view, society is an extremely potent arena. 

Rather than looking at society from an abstract level, we can work with it through the practicality of work, sex, and money. 

So from this point of view, we could see how we could possible contribute something to society... we can see something relevant to us in society. 

**The whole question boils down to whether we regard society as sacred.** Society does contain profundity and sacredness. The sacredness of society is potent and powerful.  So its important to see the spiritual aspect... the visionary aspect of society.  **We have to not only see the basic happening, but also their basic quality of energy. The energy that they contain. This is what we are looking for here.**

We have to look at what is happening. There are flashes of negative energy, flashes of positive energy, flashes of destruction, flashes of hatred and love. 

Can we approach spirituality and our relationship to society from an engaged perspective?

You are in fact apart of society.. just look at the facts.. its easy to see. The main issue is whether you are genuinely open to relating with society as part of your personal journey of spiritualy.


Does society mean anything to you on your path, or do you want to just attain individual liberation and leave society behind? Do you want to abandon all others? Do you care how society suffers who how it may gain bliss?

We could move to the country and just look at the city and laugh like they are our pet guinea pig colony. Your relationship to the city is the same as a scientist relating to their guinea pigs. This is the attitude some people have that are involved in the spiritual scene towards city dwellers.

**This is a very uncompassionate attitude.** We are laughing at other people while not seeing the contradictory and humorous aspect of our own lives. 

If that approach becomes apart of a spiritual view it becomes sickening because it regards average citizens as terrible, as failures to humanity, as embarrassing. This approach comes from preconceived ideas about living in the city and we are not willing to communicate with those preconceptions.
